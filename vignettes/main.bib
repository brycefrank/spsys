	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0727},
	abstract = {When random forests are used for binary classification, an ensemble of \$t=1,2,{\textbackslash}dots\$ randomized classifiers is generated, and the predictions of the classifiers are aggregated by majority vote. Due to the randomness in the algorithm, there is a natural tradeoff between statistical performance and computational cost. On one hand, as \$t\$ increases, the (random) prediction error of the ensemble tends to decrease and stabilize. On the other hand, larger ensembles require greater computational cost for training and making new predictions. The present work offers a new approach for quantifying this tradeoff: Given a fixed training set \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\}\$, let the random variables \${\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,1\}\$ denote the class-wise prediction error rates of a randomly generated ensemble of size \$t\$. As \$t{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\$, we provide a general bound on the "algorithmic variance", \${\textbackslash}text\{var\}({\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,l\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\}){\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}frac\{f\_l(1/2){\textasciicircum}2\}\{4t\}+o({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{t\})\$, where \$l{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}\$, and \$f\_l\$ is a density function that arises from the ensemble method. Conceptually, this result is somewhat surprising, because \${\textbackslash}text\{var\}({\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,l\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\})\$ describes how \${\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,l\}\$ varies over repeated runs of the algorithm, and yet, the formula leads to a method for bounding \${\textbackslash}text\{var\}({\textbackslash}text\{Err\}\_\{t,l\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\})\$ with a single ensemble. The bound is also sharp in the sense that it is attained by an explicit family of randomized classifiers. With regard to the task of estimating \$f\_l(1/2)\$, the presence of the ensemble leads to a unique twist on the classical setup of non-parametric density estimation --- wherein the effects of sample size and computational cost are intertwined. In particular, we propose an estimator for \$f\_l(1/2)\$, and derive an upper bound on its MSE that matches "standard optimal non-parametric rates" when \$t\$ is sufficiently large.},

	abstract = {Despite more than two decades of continuous development learning from imbalanced data is still a focus of intense research. Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

Because imputation methods can efficiently predict multiple response variables simultaneously, they may be usefully applied to map several structural attributes at the species-level. We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data. The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF). To compare and evaluate these approaches, we computed a scaled Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between observed and imputed plot-level BA and TD for 11 conifer species sampled in north-central Idaho. We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD. We concluded that RF was the most robust and flexible among the imputation methods we tested. We also concluded that canopy structure and topographic metrics derived from LiDAR surveys can be very useful for species-level imputation.},

Such aspects include ecological, economic, livelihood, and security-based and well-being benefits. The development of techniques for mapping and monitoring ETS is thus critical for understanding functioning of ecosystems. The advent of advanced imaging systems and supervised learning algorithms has provided an opportunity to map ETS over fragmenting areas. Recently, vegetation maps have been produced using advanced imaging systems such as WorldView-2 (WV-2) and robust classification algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). However, delineation of ETS in a fragmenting ecosystem using high-resolution imagery has largely remained elusive due to the complexity of the species structure and their distribution. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the utility of the advanced WV-2 data for mapping ETS in the fragmenting Dukuduku indigenous forest of South Africa using SVM and ANN classification algorithms. Specifically, the study looked at testing the advent of the additional WV-2 bands in mapping six ETS. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to separate four standard bands (SB) and four additional bands (AB). WV-2 image (8 bands: 8B) together with the SB and AB subsets was classified using SVM and ANN methods. The results showed the robustness of the two machine learning algorithms with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.00\% for SVM and 75.00\% for ANN using 8B. The SB produced OA of 65.00\% for SVM and 64.00\% for ANN. The AB produced almost the same OA of 70.00\% for both SVM and ANN. There were significant differences between the performances of the two algorithms as demonstrated by the results of McNemar's test (\${\textbackslash}text Z{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}text score {\textbackslash}geq 1.96\$). This study concludes that SVM and ANN classification algorithms with WV-2 8B have the potential to map ETS in the Dukuduku indigenous forest. This study offers relatively accurate information that is important for forest managers to make informed decisions regarding management and conservation protocols of ETS.},

Traditional methods for generating these inventories employ the use of height and proportion metrics to measure LiDAR returns and relate these back to field data using predictive models. Here, we employ a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning technique that scans the LiDAR data and automatically generates useful features for predicting forest attributes. We test the accuracy in estimating forest attributes using the three-dimensional implementations of different CNN models commonly used in the field of image recognition. Using the best performing model architecture, we compared CNN performance to models developed using traditional height metrics. The results of this comparison show that CNNs produced 12\% less prediction error when estimating biomass, 6\% less in estimating tree count, and 2\% less when estimating the percentage of needleleaf trees. We conclude that using CNNs can be a more accurate means of interpreting LiDAR data for forest inventories compared to standard approaches.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of accuracy is essential for assuring the reliability of ecological models. Usually, the accuracy of above-ground biomass (AGB) predictions obtained from remote sensing is assessed by the mean differences (MD), the root mean squared differences (RMSD), and the coefficient of determination (R2) between observed and predicted values. In this article we propose a more thorough analysis of accuracy, including a hypothesis test to evaluate the agreement between observed and predicted values, and an assessment of the degree of overfitting to the sample employed for model training. Using the estimation of forest AGB from LIDAR and spectral sensors as a case study, we compared alternative prediction and variable selection methods using several statistical measures to evaluate their accuracy. We showed that the hypothesis tests provide an objective method to infer the statistical significance of agreement. We also observed that overfitting can be assessed by comparing the inflation in residual sums of squares experienced when carrying out a cross-validation. Our results suggest that this method may be more effective than analysing the deflation in R2. We proved that overfitting needs to be specifically addressed since, in light of MD, RMSD and R2 alone, predictions may apparently seem reliable even in clearly unrealistic circumstances, for instance when including too many predictor variables. Moreover, Theil’s partial inequality coefficients, which are employed to resolve the proportions of the total errors due to the unexplained variance, the slope and the bias, may become useful to detect averaging effects common in remote sensing predictions of AGB. We concluded that statistical measures of accuracy, precision and agreement are necessary but insufficient for model evaluation. We therefore advocate for incorporating evaluation measures specifically devoted to testing observed-versus-predicted fit, and to assessing the degree of overfitting.},

	abstract = {Numerous airborne LiDAR-derived metrics have been proposed for classifying tree species. Yet an in-depth ecological and biological understanding of the significance of these metrics for tree species mapping remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of 37 frequently used LiDAR metrics derived under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions, respectively, for discriminating six different tree species in a natural forest in Germany. We firstly assessed the correlation between these metrics. Then we applied a Random Forest algorithm to classify the tree species and evaluated the importance of the LiDAR metrics. Finally, we identified the most important LiDAR metrics and tested their robustness and transferability. Our results indicated that about 60\% of LiDAR metrics were highly correlated to each other ({\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in tree species mapping accuracy between the use of leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR metrics. However, combining leaf-on and leaf-off LiDAR metrics significantly increased the overall accuracy from 58.2\% (leaf-on) and 62.0\% (leaf-off) to 66.5\% as well as the kappa coefficient from 0.47 (leaf-on) and 0.51 (leaf-off) to 0.58. Radiometric features, especially intensity related metrics, provided more consistent and significant contributions than geometric features for tree species discrimination. Specifically, the mean intensity of first-or-single returns as well as the mean value of echo width were identified as the most robust LiDAR metrics for tree species discrimination. These results indicate that metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data, especially radiometric metrics, can aid in discriminating tree species in a mixed temperate forest, and represent candidate metrics for tree species classification and monitoring in Central Europe.},

Following some notes on the historical development, criteria for "best estimator" within each approach are discussed. These criteria are applied to a series of examples, which show that several of the classical results can be obtained and reinterpreted without difficulty through the model-based theory. The role of "artificial randomization" is discussed. It is argued that the model-based framework often offers advantages over the design-based one when it comes to presenting a lucid argument in favor of some given sampling procedure.},

Currently, there is a need for standardized data processing techniques able to take into account the special properties of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we provide a seminal view on recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral image processing. Our main focus is on the design of techniques able to deal with the high-dimensional nature of the data, and to integrate the spatial and spectral information. Performance of the discussed techniques is evaluated in different analysis scenarios. To satisfy time-critical constraints in specific applications, we also develop efficient parallel implementations of some of the discussed algorithms. Combined, these parts provide an excellent snapshot of the state-of-the-art in those areas, and offer a thoughtful perspective on future potentials and emerging challenges in the design of robust hyperspectral imaging algorithms.},

The treewise description is needed for several reasons, e.g., for predicting log volumes or stand growth and for analyzing the forest structure. In this study, methods for predicting the basal area diameter distribution based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) regression are compared with methods based on parametric distributions. In the k-nn method, the predicted values for interesting variables are obtained as weighted averages of the values of neighboring observations.

By incorporating altitudinal effects into the spatial weighting matrices of the common geographically weighted regression (GWR), an extended GWR model, geographically and altitudinal weighted regression (GAWR), has been developed to deal with both spatial (horizontal) and altitudinal (vertical) non-stationarity in the data set. Unlike the common GWR model, the presented GAWR approach captures both horizontal and altitudinal drifts in the relationships between aboveground biomass and remote sensing data. In order to test its improved performance, the GAWR method was compared with the traditional GWR technique and global ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in a region of mountainous tropical rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The relationships between AGB and VIs were found to be significantly spatially variable. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in capturing both horizontal and vertical non-stationarity simultaneously. The GAWR method significantly improved AGB prediction in all simulations relative to both the traditional GWR and OLS methods, as indicated by accuracy and precision statistics. From the results of empirical tests, it seems proper to say that for this data set, the GAWR model is better than the traditional GWR model.},

Previous forest studies have demonstrated the better performance of GWR compared to OLS when calibrated and validated at sampled locations where field measurements are collected. However, the use of GWR for remote-sensing applications requires generating estimates and evaluating the model performance for the large image scene, not just for sampled locations. In this study, we introduce GWR to estimate forest canopy height using high spatial resolution Quickbird (QB) imagery and evaluate the influence of sampling density on GWR. We also examine four commonly used spatial analysis techniques – OLS, inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK) and cokriging (COK) – and compare their performance with that using GWR. Results show that (i) GWR outperformed OLS at all sampling densities; however, they produced similar results at low sampling densities, suggesting that GWR may not produce significantly better results than OLS in remote-sensing operational applications where only a small number of field data are collected. (ii) The performance of GWR was better than those of IDW, OK and COK at most sampling densities. Among the spatial interpolation techniques we examined, IDW was the best to estimate the canopy height at most densities, while COK outperformed OK only marginally and produced larger canopy height estimation errors than both IDW and GWR. (iii) GWR had the advantage of generating canopy height estimation maps with more accurate estimates than OLS, and it preserved patterns of geographic features better than IDW, OK or COK.},

In small area estimation, the EBLUPs and their approximately unbiased mean square error (MSE) estimators are obtained under the premise of having a large number of population units in the target domain. In remote sensing, single pixels are regarded as population units, and EBLUPs and MSE estimators may also be required for subdomains containing a low number of pixels or even single pixels. In this study, EBLUPs, their MSE, and an unbiased estimator of the MSE are derived when predicting linear parameters for subdomains with a small number of population units that do not intersect with the training sample. In these situations, an additional MSE component should be considered to prevent MSE underestimation. A case study illustrates the applicability of the obtained results in the context of a Light Detection and Ranging-based forest inventory, where estimates are provided for areas of interest sizing from single pixels or population units to thousands of hectares. Based on our results, we recommend to consider the additional component in the MSE estimator when estimating in pixels and domains of interest sizing few hectares.

	abstract = {For many decades remotely sensed data have been used as a source of auxiliary information when conducting regional or national surveys of forest resources. In the past decade, airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has emerged as a promising tool for sample surveys aimed at improving estimation of above-ground forest biomass. This technology is now employed routinely in forest management inventories of some Nordic countries, and there is eager anticipation for its application to assess changes in standing biomass in vast tropical regions of the globe in concert with the UN REDD program to limit C emissions. In the rapidly expanding literature on LiDAR-assisted biomass estimation the assessment of the uncertainty of estimation varies widely, ranging from statistically rigorous to ad hoc. In many instances, too, there appears to be no recognition of different bases of statistical inference which bear importantly on uncertainty estimation. Statistically rigorous assessment of uncertainty for four large LiDAR-assisted surveys is expounded.},

Many national ALS survey programmes covering entire countries for topographic mapping are currently in progress and some have provided data that are in the public domain. Although the point density of these datasets is relatively low, there is an interest in developing methods that employ these types of data for categorizing different approaches to forest management. Using Finnish national ALS data with a point density of 0.91 pulses per square metre, we carried out a classification of 252 000 ha of boreal forests into silvicultural development classes (DC) used in practical forest management. Taking into account all eight DCs, the overall accuracy was 74.1 per cent and κ = 0.70. We conclude that the dataset is adequate for discriminating multilayered forests from even-aged ones. This result was compared with a method based on mathematical rules, which succeeded in discriminating multilayered stands with regeneration of shade-intolerant species without the need of field data for training. However, the low point density may hamper the detection of shade-tolerant understories in mature high forests with closed canopies. We, therefore, recommend the use of this supervised classification in the presence of shade-tolerant species.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to (1) examine the classification of forest land using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, satellite images and sample plots of the Finnish National Forest Inventory (NFI) as training data and to (2) identify best performing metrics for classifying forest land attributes. Six different schemes of forest land classification were studied: land use/land cover (LU/LC) classification using both national classes and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) classes, main type, site type, peat land type and drainage status. Special interest was to test different ALS-based surface metrics in classification of forest land attributes. Field data consisted of 828 NFI plots collected in 2008–2012 in southern Finland and remotely sensed data was from summer 2010. Multinomial logistic regression was used as the classification method. Classification of LU/LC classes were highly accurate (kappa-values 0.90 and 0.91) but also the classification of site type, peat land type and drainage status succeeded moderately well (kappa-values 0.51, 0.69 and 0.52). ALS-based surface metrics were found to be the most important predictor variables in classification of LU/LC class, main type and drainage status. In best classification models of forest site types both spectral metrics from satellite data and point cloud metrics from ALS were used. In turn, in the classification of peat land types ALS point cloud metrics played the most important role. Results indicated that the prediction of site type and forest land category could be incorporated into stand level forest management inventory system in Finland.},

Through a case study in peatland classification using LiDAR derivatives, we present an analysis of the effects of input data characteristics on RF classifications (including RF out-of-bag error, independent classification accuracy and class proportion error). Training data selection and specific input variables (i.e., image channels) have a large impact on the overall accuracy of the image classification. High-dimension datasets should be reduced so that only uncorrelated important variables are used in classifications. Despite the fact that RF is an ensemble approach, independent error assessments should be used to evaluate RF results, and iterative classifications are recommended to assess the stability of predicted classes. Results are also shown to be highly sensitive to the size of the training data set. In addition to being as large as possible, the training data sets used in RF classification should also be (a) randomly distributed or created in a manner that allows for the class proportions of the training data to be representative of actual class proportions in the landscape; and (b) should have minimal spatial autocorrelation to improve classification results and to mitigate inflated estimates of RF out-of-bag classification accuracy.},

The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

	abstract = {Forest surveys provide critical information for many diverse interests. Data are often collected from samples, and from these samples, maps of resources and estimates of aerial totals or averages are required. In this paper, two approaches for mapping and estimating totals; the spatial linear model (SLM) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) are compared, theoretically, through simulations, and as applied to real forestry data. While both methods have desirable properties, a review shows that the SLM has prediction optimality properties, and can be quite robust. Simulations of artificial populations and resamplings of real forestry data show that the SLM has smaller empirical root-mean-squared prediction errors (RMSPE) for a wide variety of data types, with generally less bias and better interval coverage than k-NN. These patterns held for both point predictions and for population totals or averages, with the SLM reducing RMSPE from 9\% to 67\% over some popular k-NN methods, with SLM also more robust to spatially imbalanced sampling. Estimating prediction standard errors remains a problem for k-NN predictors, despite recent attempts using model-based methods.

To estimate spatial correlation, sample designs that provide close observations are needed, but their implementation might be prohibitively expensive. To quantify the gains obtained by accounting for the spatial correlation of model errors, we examined (i) the spatial correlation patterns of residuals from LiDAR linear models developed to predict volume, total and stem biomass per hectare, quadratic mean diameter (QMD), basal area, mean and dominant height, and stand density and (ii) the impact of field plot size on the spatial correlation patterns in a standwise managed Mediterranean forest in central Spain. For all variables, the correlation range of model residuals consistently increased with plot radius and was always below 60 m except for stand density, where it reached 85 m.

	abstract = {While forest inventories based on airborne laser scanning data (ALS) using the area based approach (ABA) have reached operational status, methods using the individual tree crown approach (ITC) have basically remained a research issue. One of the main obstacles for operational applications of ITC is biased results often experienced due to segmentation errors. In this article, we propose a new method, called “semi-ITC” that overcomes the main problems related to ITC by imputing ground truth data within crown segments from the nearest neighboring segment. This may be none, one, or several trees. The distances between segments were derived based on a set of explanatory variables using two nonparametric methods, i.e., most similar neighbor inference (MSN) and random forest (RF). RF favored the imputation of common observations in the data set which resulted in significant biases. Main conclusions are therefore based on MSN. The explanatory variables were calculated by means of small footprint ALS and multispectral data. When testing with empirical data the new method compared favorably to the well-known ABA. Another advantage of the new method over the ABA is that it allowed for the modeling of rare tree species. The results of predicting timber volume with the semi-ITC method were unbiased and the root mean squared error (RMSE) on plot level was smaller than the standard deviation of the observed response variables. The relative RMSEs after cross validation using semi-ITC for total volume and volume of the individual species pine, spruce, birch, and aspen on plot level were 17, 38, 40, 101, and 222\%, respectively. Due to the unbiasedness of the estimation, this study is a showcase for how to use crown segments resulting from ITC algorithms in a forest inventory context.},

	abstract = {Wildlife habitat selection is determined by a wide range of factors including food availability, shelter, security and landscape heterogeneity all of which are closely related to the more readily mapped landcover types and disturbance regimes. Regional wildlife habitat studies often used moderate resolution multispectral satellite imagery for wall to wall mapping, because it offers a favourable mix of availability, cost and resolution. However, certain habitat characteristics such as canopy structure and topographic factors are not well discriminated with these passive, optical datasets. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides highly accurate three dimensional data on canopy structure and the underlying terrain, thereby offers significant enhancements to wildlife habitat mapping. In this paper, we introduce an approach to integrate ALS data and multispectral images to develop a new heuristic wildlife habitat classifier for western Alberta. Our method combines ALS direct measures of canopy height, and cover with optical estimates of species (conifer vs. deciduous) composition into a decision tree classifier for habitat – or landcover types. We believe this new approach is highly versatile and transferable, because class rules can be easily adapted for other species or functional groups. We discuss the implications of increased ALS availability for habitat mapping and wildlife management and provide recommendations for integrating multispectral and ALS data into wildlife management.},

	abstract = {The northeastern United States is currently experiencing a decline in forested lands, primarily due to the expansion of human development. Of particular concern is the loss of “core areas” or the areas within forests that are not influenced by other land cover types. Core areas are of significant importance to native flora and fauna, since they generally are less vulnerable to invasion by exotics and are more resilient to the effects of climate change. However, the exact reduction of core area in the northeast is still unknown. Current methods of estimation are not particularly precise, since areas of edge influence are quite variable and situational. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to devise a new method for identifying edge influence areas using remote sensing techniques. Eight transects were sampled perpendicular to the edge of an abandoned golf course within Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA. Vegetation inventories as well as Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) at different heights within the canopy were used to determine edge depth in the field. Small-footprint discrete aerial LiDAR datasets were comparatively used to identify edge depths. LiDAR returns were binned and transformed into canopy height profiles before the sum of squared differences was used to determine where edge influence diminished, creating a LiDAR derived edge depth. LiDAR estimated edge depths were not significantly different from the field identified edge depths, indicating it might be a low-cost method for estimating edge depths.},

New tools for collection of data on forest bird response to fine-grained forest structure provide opportunities to evaluate habitat thresholds for forest birds. We used LiDAR-derived estimates of habitat attributes and resource selection to evaluate foraging habitat thresholds for recovery of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis; RCW) on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. First, we generated utilization distributions to define habitat use and availability for 30 RCW groups surveyed over a {\textgreater}4-h period twice per month between April 2013 and March 2015. Next, we used piecewise regression to characterize RCW threshold responses to LiDAR-derived habitat attributes described in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan for RCW. Finally, we used resource utilization functions to estimate selection of specific habitat thresholds and used the magnitude of selection to prioritize thresholds for conservation. We identified lower and upper thresholds for densities of pines ≥35.6cmdbh (22, 65 trees/ha), basal area (BA) of pines ≥25.4cmdbh (1.4, 2.2m2/ha), hardwood canopy cover (6, 31\%), and BA of hardwoods 7.6–22.9cmdbh (0.4, 6.07m2/ha); we identified three thresholds for density of pines 7.6–25.4cmdbh (56, 341, and 401 trees/ha). Selection rankings prioritized foraging habitat with {\textless}6\% hardwood canopy cover (β=0.254, 95\% CI=0.172–0.336),{\textless}1.2 m2/ha BA of hardwoods 7.6–22.9cmdbh (β=0.162, 95\% CI=0.050–0.275), ≥1.4m2/ha BA of pines ≥25.4cmdbh (β=0.055, 95\% CI=0.022–0.087), and ≥22 pines ≥35.6cmdbh/ha (β=0.015, 95\% CI=0.013–0.042). We identified habitat thresholds corresponding to open canopy structure, moderate densities of large and medium pines, and sparse hardwood midstory trees. Selection ranks prioritized multiple thresholds below USFWS range-wide recovery thresholds, indicating site-specific management goals may be beneficial for RCW conservation. Fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data coupled with GPS-derived habitat use can guide forest bird conservation by identifying the full range of structural conditions associated with threshold responses.},

	abstract = {LiDAR technology has firmly contributed to strengthen the knowledge of habitat structure-wildlife relationships, though there is an evident bias towards flying vertebrates. To bridge this gap, we investigated and compared the performance of LiDAR and field data to model habitat preferences of wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in a Mediterranean high mountain pine forest (Pinus sylvestris). We recorded nine field and 13 LiDAR variables that were summarized by means of Principal Component Analyses (PCA). We then analyzed wood mouse’s habitat preferences using three different models based on: (i) field PCs predictors, (ii) LiDAR PCs predictors; and (iii) both set of predictors in a combined model, including a variance partitioning analysis. Elevation was also included as a predictor in the three models. Our results indicate that LiDAR derived variables were better predictors than field-based variables. The model combining both data sets slightly improved the predictive power of the model. Field derived variables indicated that wood mouse was positively influenced by the gradient of increasing shrub cover and negatively affected by elevation. Regarding LiDAR data, two LiDAR PCs, i.e. gradients in canopy openness and complexity in forest vertical structure positively influenced wood mouse, although elevation interacted negatively with the complexity in vertical structure, indicating wood mouse’s preferences for plots with lower elevations but with complex forest vertical structure. The combined model was similar to the LiDAR-based model and included the gradient of shrub cover measured in the field. Variance partitioning showed that LiDAR-based variables, together with elevation, were the most important predictors and that part of the variation explained by shrub cover was shared. LiDAR derived variables were good surrogates of environmental characteristics explaining habitat preferences by the wood mouse. Our LiDAR metrics represented structural features of the forest patch, such as the presence and cover of shrubs, as well as other characteristics likely including time since perturbation, food availability and predation risk. Our results suggest that LiDAR is a promising technology for further exploring habitat preferences by small mammal communities.},

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended ({\textasciitilde}104,000ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87\% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8\%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8\%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result, {\textasciitilde}80\% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km2 and 58.4 km2, respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6\% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.},

This study presents a new method for estimating and monitoring snags using neighborhood attribute filtered airborne discrete-return lidar data. The method first develops and then applies an automated filtering algorithm that utilizes three dimensional neighborhood lidar point-based intensity and density statistics to remove lidar points associated with live trees and retain lidar points associated with snags. A traditional airborne lidar individual-tree detection procedure is then applied to the snag-filtered lidar point cloud, resulting in stem map of identified snags with height estimates. The filtering algorithm was developed using training datasets comprised of four different forest types in wide range of stand conditions, and then applied to independent data to determine successful snag detection rates. Detection rates ranged from 43 to 100\%, increasing as the size of snags increased. The overall detection rate for snags with DBH≥25cm was 56\% (±2.9\%) with low commission error rates. The method provides the ability to estimate snag density and stem map a large proportion of snags across the landscape. The resulting information can be used to analyze the spatial distribution of snags, provide a better understanding of wildlife snag use dynamics, assess achievement of stocking standard requirements, and bring more clarity to snag stocking standards.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the use of models for increasing the precision of estimators in large-area forest surveys. It is motivated by the increasing availability of remotely sensed data, which facilitates the development of models predicting the variables of interest in forest surveys. We present, review and compare three different estimation frameworks where models play a core role: model-assisted, model-based, and hybrid estimation. The first two are well known, whereas the third has only recently been introduced in forest surveys. Hybrid inference mixes design-based and model-based inference, since it relies on a probability sample of auxiliary data and a model predicting the target variable from the auxiliary data..We review studies on large-area forest surveys based on model-assisted, model-based, and hybrid estimation, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the approaches. We conclude that no general recommendations can be made about whether model-assisted, model-based, or hybrid estimation should be preferred. The choice depends on the objective of the survey and the possibilities to acquire appropriate field and remotely sensed data. We also conclude that modelling approaches can only be successfully applied for estimating target variables such as growing stock volume or biomass, which are adequately related to commonly available remotely sensed data, and thus purely field based surveys remain important for several important forest parameters.},

These have usually considered tree stock as a whole, even though it is tree species-specific forest information that is of primary interest in Finland, for example. We will therefore concentrate here on prediction of the species-specific forest variables volume, stem number, basal area, basal area median diameter and tree height, applying the non-parametric k-MSN method to a combination of ALS data and aerial photographs in order to predict these stand attributes simultaneously for Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees as well as total characteristics as sums of the species-specific estimates. The predictor variables derived from the ALS data were based on the height distribution of vegetation hits, whereas spectral values and texture features were employed in the case of the aerial photographs. The data covered 463 sample plots in 67 stands in eastern Finland, and the results showed that this approach can be used to predict species-specific forest variables at least as accurately as from the current stand-level field inventory for Finland. The characteristics of Scots pine and Norway spruce were predicted more accurately than those of deciduous trees.},

Live tree biomass (dry metric tons) varies widely across the US with the largest amounts in the Pacific Northwest region followed by the hardwood forests of the eastern US. In contrast, the range of relative density appears to be less disparate with numerous forests across the US having densities as high as areas in the Pacific Northwest. Overall, the large-scale assessment of relative density indicates that the majority of forests in the US are fully occupied in a rather contiguous pattern except for areas of the western US.},

	abstract = {In many applications, estimates are required for small sub-populations with so few (or no) sample plots that direct estimators that do not utilize auxiliary variables (e.g. remotely sensed data) are not applicable or result in low precision. This problem is overcome in small area estimation (SAE) by linking the variable of interest to auxiliary variables using a model. Two types of models can be distinguished based on the scale on which they operate: i) Unit-level models are applied in the well-known area-based approach (ABA) and are commonly used in forest inventories supported by fine-resolution 3D remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) or digital aerial photogrammetry (AP); ii) Area-level models, where the response is a direct estimate based on a sample within the domain and the explanatory variables are aggregated auxiliary variables, are less frequently applied. Estimators associated with these two model types can make use of sample plots within domains if available and reduce to so-called synthetic estimators in domains where no sample plots are available. We used both model types and their associated model-based estimators in the same study area with AP data as auxiliary variables. Heteroscedasticity, i.e. for continuous dependent variables typically an increasing dispersion of residuals with increasing predictions, is often observed in models linking field- and remotely sensed data. This violates the model assumption that the distribution of the residual errors is constant. Complying with model assumptions is required for model-based methods to result in reliable estimates. Addressing heteroscedasticity in models had considerable impacts on standard errors. When complying with model assumptions, the precision of estimates based on unit-level models was, on average, considerably greater (29\%–31\% smaller standard errors) than those based on area-level models. Area-level models may nonetheless be attractive because they allow the use of sampling designs that do not easily link to remotely sensed data, such as variable radius plots.},

	abstract = {Canopy structure plays an essential role in biophysical activities in forest environments. However, quantitative descriptions of a 3-D canopy structure are extremely difficult because of the complexity and heterogeneity of forest systems. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides an opportunity to automatically measure a 3-D canopy structure in large areas. Compared with other point cloud technologies such as the image-based Structure from Motion, the power of ALS lies in its ability to penetrate canopies and depict subordinate trees. However, such capabilities have been poorly explored so far. In this paper, the potential of ALS-based approaches in depicting a 3-D canopy structure is explored in detail through an international benchmarking of five recently developed ALS-based individual tree detection (ITD) methods. For the first time, the results of the ITD methods are evaluated for each of four crown classes, i.e., dominant, codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees, which provides insight toward understanding the current status of depicting a 3-D canopy structure using ITD methods, particularly with respect to their performances, potential, and challenges. This benchmarking study revealed that the canopy structure plays a considerable role in the detection accuracy of ITD methods, and its influence is even greater than that of the tree species as well as the species composition in a stand. The study also reveals the importance of utilizing the point cloud data for the detection of intermediate and suppressed trees. Different from what has been reported in previous studies, point density was found to be a highly influential factor in the performance of the methods that use point cloud data. Greater efforts should be invested in the point-based or hybrid ITD approaches to model the 3-D canopy structure and to further explore the potential of high-density and multiwavelengths ALS data.},

Small-area estimation (SAE) is a set of techniques well suited to estimation of forest attributes for small areas in which the existing sample size is small and auxiliary information is available. Selected SAE methods were compared for estimating a variety of forest attributes for small areas using ground data and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived auxiliary information. The small areas of interest consisted of delineated stands within a larger forested population. Four different estimation methods were compared for predicting forest density (number of trees/ha), quadratic mean diameter (cm), basal area (m2/ha), top height (m), and cubic stem volume (m3/ha). The precision and bias of the estimation methods (synthetic prediction (SP), multiple linear regression based composite prediction (CP), empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) via Fay–Herrio..., Un des défis souvent rencontrés en foresterie est l’estimation des attributs forestiers pour de plus petites zones d’intérêt au sein d’une population plus large qu’est la forêt.

Quatre méthodes d’estimation pour petites zones ont été sélectionnées et comparées pour estimer une variété d’attributs forestiers sur de petites superficies à l’aide de données terrain et de données auxiliaires dérivées du lidar.

The first set included three base equations for estimating biomass increment as a function of lidar metrics, and the remaining equations enhanced the three base equations by considering the hierarchical structure of the data.
It is shown that the mixed effect framework substantially improved the accuracy and precision of biomass increment prediction over the fixed effects that assume the observations are independent for the area covered by two lidar acquisitions, 5 years apart from one another. On the average, root mean square error values were reduced by 19.8\% by using a plot-level random coefficient model that account for the impacts of site (biophysical factors) on biomass increment on the western Kenai Peninsula.
Mixed effect models are effective statistical tools, but their effective application requires some sample growth data. As such, we recommend two models for estimating biomass increment on the Kenai Peninsula. If a subsample of ground data is available to predict the plot random intercept, the enhanced model is suggested.},

	abstract = {Forest inventories require estimates and measures of uncertainty for subpopulations such as management units. These units often times hold a small sample size, so they should be regarded as small areas. When auxiliary information is available, different small area estimation methods have been proposed to obtain reliable estimates for small areas. Unit level empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUP) based on plot or grid unit level models have been studied more thoroughly than area level EBLUPs, where the modelling occurs at the management unit scale. Area level EBLUPs do not require a precise plot positioning and allow the use of variable radius plots, thus reducing fieldwork costs. However, their performance has not been examined thoroughly. We compared unit level and area level EBLUPs, using LiDAR auxiliary information collected for inventorying 98,104 ha coastal coniferous forest. Unit level models were consistently more accurate than area level EBLUPs, and area level EBLUPs were consistently more accurate than field estimates except for large management units that held a large sample. For stand density, volume, basal area, quadratic mean diameter, mean height and Lorey’s height, root mean squared errors (rmses) of estimates obtained using area level EBLUPs were, on average, 1.43, 2.83, 2.09, 1.40, 1.32 and 1.64 times larger than those based on unit level estimates, respectively. Similarly, direct field estimates had rmses that were, on average, 1.37, 1.45, 1.17, 1.17, 1.26, and 1.38 times larger than rmses of area level EBLUPs. Therefore, area level models can lead to substantial gains in accuracy compared to direct estimates, and unit level models lead to very important gains in accuracy compared to area level models, potentially justifying the additional costs of obtaining accurate field plot coordinates.},

An established practice in forest inventory is that trees with boles falling within a fixed border field measurement plot are considered “in” trees; yet their crowns may extend beyond the plot border. Likewise, a tree bole may fall outside of a plot, but its crown may extend into a plot. Typical ABA approaches do not recognize these discrepancies between the ALS data extracted for a given plot and the corresponding field measurements. In the proposed solution, enhanced ABA (EABA), predicted tree positions, and crown shapes are used to adjust plot and grid cell boundaries and how ALS metrics are computed. The idea is to append crowns of “in” trees to a plot and cut down “out” trees, then EABA continues in the traditional fashion as ABA. The EABA method requires higher density ALS data than ABA because improvement is obtained by means of detecting individual trees. When compared to typical ABA, the proposed EABA method decreased the error rate (RMSE) of stem volume prediction from 23.16\% to 19.11\% with 127 m2 plots and from 19.08\% to 16.95\% with 254 m2 plots. The greatest improvements were obtained for plots with the largest residuals.},

This new modeling approach does not adopt standard approaches of stepwise regression using a series of height metrics derived from airborne LiDAR. Rather, it used four metrics describing complementary 3D structural aspects of the stand canopy. The first three metrics were related to mean canopy height, height heterogeneity, and horizontal canopy distribution. A fourth metric was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the leaf area density profile. This fourth metric provided information on understory vegetation. The models that were developed with the four structural metrics provided higher estimation accuracy on stand attributes than models using height metrics alone, while also avoiding data over-fitting. Overall, the models provided prediction error levels ranging from 12.4\% to 24.2\%, depending upon forest type and stand attribute. The more homogeneous coniferous stand provided the highest estimation accuracy. Estimation errors were significantly reduced in mixed forest when separate models were developed for individual stand types (coniferous, mixed and deciduous stands) instead of a general model for all stand types. Model robustness was also evaluated in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions where both conditions provided similar estimation errors.},

	abstract = {Ground reference data collection represents an important element in the prediction of stem volume with LiDAR-derived variables, and at present it is the most expensive part of such analyses. In this paper two aspects of ground reference data collection were analyzed: (1) the positioning error of the ground plots; and (2) the optimal number of training plots. A system for the prediction of stem volume at area-based level was adopted. LiDAR data were preprocessed and 13 variables describing both height and coverage were extracted. Models were defined using a stepwise ordinary least square (OLS) regression. Three experiments were conducted: (i) the role of the plots positioning error on prediction accuracy; (ii) the influence of random downsampling of plot numbers on prediction accuracy; and (iii) the influence of a stratified downsampling of plot numbers on prediction accuracy based on LiDAR-derived variables. A dataset comprising 799 ground plots was used. They were distributed throughout a mountainous area in the Southern Alps, where the presence of a complex landscape increases the uncertainty of the Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy, and where a large variety of tree forest species and climatic environments make it necessary to have a large number of sample plots for accurate characterization of the study area. All the experiments provided important indications for LiDAR based forest inventories: the GPS error did not significantly influence the prediction accuracy and it was possible to reduce the number of training samples without compromising the generalization ability of the prediction model. Leading on from these findings, a new ground sampling protocol based on genetic algorithms was proposed. The new protocol allowed us to obtain promising results for the considered dataset: using only 53 training plots, instead of 534 in the original dataset, we obtained the same results for the validation set. These results, obtained in a complex mountainous area, are representative of Alpine environments and allow us to infer that similar (or better) results could also be obtained within non mountainous areas.},

When full cover auxiliary information is available at the planning stage of a forest inventory, an efficient strategy for sampling is formed by making sure that the sample is well spread in the space spanned by the auxiliary variables. We show that by using such a sampling design, we can improve not only design-based estimation, but also estimation based on nearest neighbour techniques. A new technique to select well-spread probability samples, in multidimensional spaces, from larger populations is introduced. As an application, we illustrate how this strategy can be applied to a forest field inventory. We use an artificial dataset corresponding to a full cover forest remote sensing inventory of a 30 000 ha area of Kuortane, western Finland. The target variable (growing stock volume) has been generated for the entire area by a copula technique. The artificial population has been validated by utilizing the Finnish National Forest Inventory. (English)},

To achieve these goals, raw data were segmented into a net, and different cell dimensions were investigated to maximize the relationship between the LIDAR data and the ground-truth information. Twenty predicting variables (e.g., mean height, coefficient of variation) have been extracted from multi-return LIDAR data, and a multiple linear regression analysis has been used for predicting tree stem volume. Experimental results found that the optimal resolutions of the net square cells were 40 m. The analysis indicated that in a mixed multi-layered forest, characterized by a complex vertical structure, the correct selection of the map spatial resolution and the inclusion of the secondary-return data were important factors for improving the effectiveness of the laser scanning approach in forest inventories. The experimental tests showed that the chosen model is effective for the estimation of stem volume over the analyzed area, providing good results on all the three considered validation methods.},

The reference AGB of the available sample plots is calculated from forest inventory data by means of biomass expansion factors. Furthermore, the semi-empirical model is extended by three different canopy transparency parameters derived from airborne LiDAR data. These parameters have not been considered for stem volume estimation until now and are introduced in order to investigate the behavior of the model concerning AGB estimation. The developed additional input parameters are based on the assumption that transparency of vegetation can be measured by determining the penetration of the laser beams through the canopy. These parameters are calculated for every single point within the 3D point cloud in order to consider the varying properties of the vegetation in an appropriate way. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to evaluate the influence of the additional LiDAR derived canopy transparency parameters for AGB estimation. The study is carried out in a 560 km2 alpine area in Austria, where reference forest inventory data and LiDAR data are available. The investigations show that the introduction of the canopy transparency parameters does not change the results significantly according to R2 (R2 = 0.70 to R2 = 0.71) in comparison to the results derived from, the semi-empirical model, which was originally developed for stem volume estimation.},

One purpose of this study was to verify whether angle count samples can be used as suitable ground truth to calibrate LiDAR-based models for timber volume estimation. Volume data were acquired on the ground for 79 plots in the Latemar forest (province of Bolzano, Italian Alps). A simple linear regression model, using the sum of all of the tree canopy heights in the plot as the explanatory variable, was adopted. As angle count samples have no fixed area, three different methods to approximate their size were compared. The angle count sample area can be properly approximated by visual assessment of the tree size classes and by callipering the largest tree in the plot. The results show that angle count sampling can be an efficient solution to calibrate LiDAR-based models: they produced fair estimates at the plot level (relative root mean square error (RMSE), 26.6\%) that were better than fixed-radius plot estimates with full callipering (RMSE, 29.7\%). Estimate uncertainty at increasingly large forest stand areas was also calculated by means of a simulation procedure. It showed that low uncertainty (standard error of estimate = approximately 2\%) could be reached at a forest compartment level (19 ha on average). (English)},

	abstract = {Key message The effects on large-area volume estimates of uncertainty in individual tree volume model predictions were negligible when using simple random sampling estimators for large-area estimation, but non-negligible when using stratified estimators which reduced the effects of sampling variability. Context Forest inventory estimates of tree volume for large areas are typically calculated by adding model predictions of volumes for individual trees at the plot level and calculating the per unit area mean over plots. The uncertainty in the model predictions is generally ignored with the result that the precision of the large-area volume estimate is optimistic. Aims The primary objective was to estimate the effects on large-area volume estimates of volume model prediction uncertainty due to diameter and height measurement error, parameter uncertainty, and model residual variance. Methods Monte Carlo simulation approaches were used because of the complexities associated with multiple sources of uncertainty, the non-linear nature of the models, and heteroskedasticity. Results The effects of model prediction uncertainty on large-area volume estimates of growing stock volume were negligible when using simple random sampling estimators. However, with stratified estimators that reduce the effects of sampling variability, the effects of model prediction uncertainty were not necessarily negligible. The adverse effects of parameter uncertainty and residual variance were greater than the effects of diameter and height measurement errors. Conclusion The uncertainty of large-area volume estimates that do not account for model prediction uncertainty should be regarded with caution.},

	abstract = {Georeferencing field plots by means of GPS/GLONASS techniques is becoming compulsory for many applications concerning forest management and inventory. True coordinates obtained in a total station traverse were compared against GPS/GLONASS occupations computed from one navigation-grade and three survey-grade receivers. Records were taken under a high Pinus sylvestris L. forest canopy situated in a mountainous area in central Spain. The horizontal component of the absolute error was a better descriptor of the performance of GPS/GLONASS receivers compared to the precision computed by the proprietary software. The vertical component of absolute error also failed to show the effects revealed when the horizontal one was studied. These differences might be critical for applications involving high-demanding surveys, in which a comparison against a terrestrially surveyed ground truth is still mandatory for accuracy assessment in forested mountainous areas. Moreover, a comparison of diverse Differential GPS/GLONASS techniques showed that the effect of lengthening the baseline and lowering the logging rate was not significant in this study. Differences among methods and receivers were only observed for recording periods between 5 and 15 minutes. The hand-held receiver was inappropriate for plot establishment due to its inaccuracy and a low rate of fixed solutions, though it may be used for forest campaigns tolerating low precision or permitting the employment of periods of 20 minutes or longer for plot mensuration.},

	abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has become an essential tool in the Earth observation field for georeferencing, classification and accuracy assessment activities. While it was developed to be employed primarily in the open, many users nowadays operate GPS receivers in less favourable conditions. We investigated the impact of varying types and degrees of forest cover overstorey on GPS data collection, accuracy and precision. While the occurrence of canopy overhead may degrade the positional precision by one order of magnitude, it is the presence of the foliage itself (leaf-on condition) that plays a major role in the signal reception and the positional accuracy. The relationship is inverse, with increasing relative canopy closure resulting in decreasing logging efficiency and accuracy. We also found that under larger forest canopy the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) values may improve signal reception without deteriorating accuracy. Moreover, the relationship between degree of canopy closure and the accuracy RMSE follows an exponential pattern with small increases in relative canopy closure leading to huge increases in positional error. Averaging proved to be a powerful way to diminish residual positional error under forest cover, 300 fixes being proposed as a good number for GPS data acquisition under mature canopy conditions. Ultimately, we judged that PDOP is not as good an indicator for positional accuracy under forest canopy as is universally acclaimed.},

There were significant differences between forest types (P {\textless} 0.001) and antenna heights (P {\textless} 0.05). Positioning precision was not noticeably improved if the sampling number was around ten or less. A sampling number of 100â€“1000 or more is required before substantial improvements can be expected.

In field tests, a rover was set up at four observation points, each representing a different condition within a forest. At each observation point, static surveying was conducted for four periods of 30ΓÇëmin, and data from the first 1, 5, 15, and 30ΓÇëmin from each observation point were extracted for analysis. The position of each point was calculated by baseline analysis using three types of GPS data, i.e., dual-frequency (L1 and L2), single-frequency (L1), and code-phase DGPS data. The results showed that ambiguity resolution was a key factor in determining the horizontal accuracy of carrier-phase DGPS, and that the success probability of ambiguity resolution differed greatly according to forest conditions, which were well explained not by the index of the canopy opening but by the SIP. Furthermore, estimation of the success probability of ambiguity resolution was made based on the SIP and the observation period using a logistic regression model. The horizontal precision of code-phase DGPS was also estimated based on the SIP and the observation period. In conclusion, the SIP was found to be an effective indicator of GPS positional accuracy under different forest conditions.},

Reported LiDAR errors range from 17 to 40MgCha−1, but should be lower at coarser resolutions because relative errors are expected to scale with (plot area)–1/2. We tested this prediction empirically using a 50-ha plot with mapped trees, allowing an assessment of LiDAR prediction errors at multiple spatial resolutions. We found that errors scaled approximately as expected, declining by 38\% (compared to 40\% predicted from theory) from 0.36- to 1-ha resolution. We further reduced errors at all spatial resolutions by accounting for tree crowns that are bisected by plot edges (not typically done in forestry), and collectively show that airborne LiDAR can map carbon stocks with 10\% error at 1-ha resolution — a level comparable to the use of field plots alone.},

The estimates are used for local and national purposes and for reporting to international agreements such as the Montréal Process, the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, and the Kyoto Protocol. The estimates are usually based on sample plot data and are calculated using probability-based estimators. These estimators are familiar, generally unbiased, and entail only limited computational complexity, but they do not produce the maps that users are increasingly requesting, and they generally do not produce sufficiently precise estimates for small areas. Model-based estimators overcome these disadvantages, but they may be biased and estimation of variances may be computationally intensive. The study objective was to compare probability- and model-based estimators of mean proportion forest using maps based on a logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and Landsat imagery. For model-based estimators, methods for evaluating bias and reducing the computational intensity were also investigated. Four conclusions were drawn: the logistic regression model exhibited no serious lack of fit to the data; all the estimators produced comparable estimates for mean proportion forest, except for small areas; probability-based inferences enhanced using maps produced increased precision; and the computational intensity associated with estimating variances for model-based estimators can be greatly reduced with no detrimental effects.},

	abstract = {Integration of remote sensing (RS) data in forest inventories for enhancing plot-based forest variable prediction is a widely researched topic. Geometric consistency between forest inventory plots and areas for extraction of RS-based predictive metrics is considered a crucial factor for accurate modelling of forest variables. Achieving geometric consistency is particularly difficult with regard to angle-count sampling (ACS) plots, which have neither distinct shape nor distinct extent. This initial study considers a new approach for integrating ACS and RS data, where the concept of ACS is transferred to RS-based metrics extraction. By using the relationship between tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH), pixels of a RS-based canopy height model are extracted if their value suggests a DBH that would lead to inclusion in an angle-count sample at the given distance to the plot centre. Different variations of this approach are tested by modelling timber volume in national forest inventory plots in Germany. The results are compared to those achieved using fixed-radius plots. A root mean square error of approximately 42\% is achieved by both the new and fixed-radius approaches. Therefore, the new approach is not yet considered sufficient for overcoming all difficulties concerning the integration of ACS plot and RS data. However, possibilities for improvement are discussed and will be the subject of further research.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, forest-stand delineation has been assessed based on orthophotography. The application of LiDAR has improved forest management by providing high-spatial-resolution data on the vertical structure of the forest. The aim of this study was to develop and test a semi-automated algorithm for stands delineation in a plantation of Pinus sylvestris L. using LiDAR data. Three specific objectives were evaluated, i) to assess two complementary LiDAR metrics, Assmann dominant height and basal area, for the characterization of the structure of P. sylvestris Mediterranean forests based on object-oriented segmentation, ii) to evaluate the influence of the LiDAR pulse density on forest-stand delineation accuracy, and iii) to investigate the algorithmś effectiveness in the delineation of P. sylvestris stands for map prediction of Assmann dominant height and basal area. Our results show that it is possible to generate accurate P. sylvestris forest-stand segmentations using multiresolution or mean shift segmentation methods, even with low-pulse-density LiDAR − which is an important economic advantage for forest management. However, eCognition multiresolution methods provided better results than the OTB (Orfeo Tool Box) for stand delineation based on dominant height and basal area estimations. Furthermore, the influence of pulse density on the results was not statistically significant in the basal area calculations. However, there was a significant effect of pulse density on Assmann dominant height [F2,9595=5.69, p=0.003].for low pulse density. We propose that the approach shown here should be considered for stand delineation in other large Pinus plantations in Mediterranean regions with similar characteristics.},

	abstract = {Regional scale maps of homogeneous forest stands are valued by forest managers and are of interest for landscape and ecological modelling. Research focused on stand delineation has substantially increased in the last decade thanks to the development of Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA). Nevertheless, studies focused on even-age dominated forests are still few and the proposed approaches are often heuristic, local, or lacking objective evaluation protocols. In this study, we present a two-stage evaluation strategy combining both unsupervised and supervised evaluation methods for semi-automatic delineation of forest stands at regional scales using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) raster summary metrics. The methodology is demonstrated on two contiguous LiDAR datasets covering more than 54,000 ha in central Idaho, where clearcuts were a common harvesting method during the twentieth century. Results show good delineation of even-aged forests and demonstrate the ability of LiDAR to discriminate stands harvested more than 50 years ago, that are generally challenging to discriminate with optical data. The two-stage strategy reduces the reference data required within the supervised evaluation and increases the scope of a reliable semi-automatic delineation to larger areas. This is an objective and straightforward approach that could potentially be replicated and adapted to address other study needs.},

	abstract = {Different small area estimation techniques have been applied to forest inventories assisted with LiDAR auxiliary information to produce estimates and measures of uncertainty for management units (MUs) for which sample sizes are too small to derive MU specific models. Unit-level (empirical best linear unbiased predictors) EBLUPs are developed at a plot or grid unit scale, have been studied more thoroughly in the literature than area-level EBLUPs and have shown important gains in efficiency when compared to 
field-only estimates. For area-level EBLUPs models are developed at the MU scale and are an appealing alternative as they do not require precise plot positioning and eliminate fieldwork costs. However, MUs are orders of magnitude larger than grid units. For large MUs one can expect lower gains in efficiency when area-level models are used instead unit-level models. Recent research pointed out that the MU size can be an important factor conditioning the accuracy of area-level EBLUPs.

We performed a direct comparison of unit and area-level EBLUPs, both using LiDAR auxiliary information, in two different scenarios with MUs of different sizes. PyFor, a Python package for LiDAR processing, was used to prepare the point clouds. The attributes subject to study were stand density, volume, basal area. Preliminary results for the first scenario where the average MU size was 981.04 ha These results suggest that area-level EBLUPs can be a very appealing alternative especially for small scale forest inventories.},

	abstract = {Credit scoring is an effective tool for banks to properly guide decision profitably on granting loans. Ensemble methods, which according to their structures can be divided into parallel and sequential ensembles, have been recently developed in the credit scoring domain. These methods have proven their superiority in discriminating borrowers accurately. However, among the ensemble models, little consideration has been provided to the following: (1) highlighting the hyper-parameter tuning of base learner despite being critical to well-performed ensemble models; (2) building sequential models (i.e., boosting, as most have focused on developing the same or different algorithms in parallel); and (3) focusing on the comprehensibility of models. This paper aims to propose a sequential ensemble credit scoring model based on a variant of gradient boosting machine (i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)). The model mainly comprises three steps. First, data pre-processing is employed to scale the data and handle missing values. Second, a model-based feature selection system based on the relative feature importance scores is utilized to remove redundant variables. Third, the hyper-parameters of XGBoost are adaptively tuned with Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization and used to train the model with selected feature subset. Several hyper-parameter optimization methods and baseline classifiers are considered as reference points in the experiment. Results demonstrate that Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization performs better than random search, grid search, and manual search. Moreover, the proposed model outperforms baseline models on average over four evaluation measures: accuracy, error rate, the area under the curve (AUC) H measure (AUC-H measure), and Brier score. The proposed model also provides feature importance scores and decision chart, which enhance the interpretability of credit scoring model.},

A combination of individual tree detection (ITD) and an area-basedapproach (ABA) introduced in Vastaranta et al. [1] to map forest aboveground biomass(AGB) and stem volume (VOL) was investigated. The main objective of this study was totest the usability and accuracy of LiDAR in biomass mapping. The nearest neighbourmethod was used in the ABA imputations and the accuracy of the biomass estimation wasevaluated in the Finland, where single tree-level biomass models are available. The relativeroot-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) in plot-level AGB and VOL imputation were 24.9\%and 26.4\% when field measurements were used in training the ABA. When ITDmeasurements were used in training, the respective accuracies ranged between 28.5\%–34.9\%and 29.2\%–34.0\%. Overall, the results show that accurate plot-level AGB estimates can beachieved with the ABA. The reduction of bias in ABA estimates in AGB and VOL wasencouraging when visually corrected ITD (ITDvisual) was used in training. We conclude that itis not feasible to use ITDvisual in wall-to-wall forest biomass inventory, but it could provide acost-efficient application for acquiring training data for ABA in forest biomass mapping.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the k-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of k. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions.

	abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

	abstract = {We studied the composition and structure of the understory in thinned and unthinned Douglas-fir/western hemlock stands on 32 sites in western Oregon. These stands had regenerated naturally after timber was harvested between 1880 and 1940; they were thinned between 1969 and 1984. Commercially thinned stands had 8–60\% of their volume removed 10–24 years before the study. Undisturbed old-growth Douglas-fir stands were present for comparison on 20 of these paired sites. Conifer regeneration density and frequency were consistently greater in thinned than unthinned stands. For example, average seedling density in thinned stands (1433/ha) was significantly (p≤0.001) greater than in unthinned stands (233/ha), but very similar to that in old-growth stands (1010/ha). Seedling density and frequency were strongly related to the volume removed and to stand density index (and other measures of overstory density) just after thinning. In thinned stands, the density of small trees (intermediate crown class overstory trees and advanced regeneration) was 159/ha, significantly (p≤0.001) greater than in unthinned stands (90/ha), but not significantly different from that of old-growth (204/ha). The live crown ratio of these trees in thinned stands (66\%) was greater than in unthinned (44\%) and old-growth (48\%) stands. Cover and stem density of shrubs was variable in all three stand types. There was significantly less tall shrub cover in unthinned stands than in either thinned or old-growth stands, which did not differ. Thinned stands had the most low shrub cover. Salal and bracken fern cover was greater in thinned stands than in the other stand types, but there was no difference in sword fern and Oregongrape cover. Leaf area index in thinned stands (6.6) was not significantly different from that in unthinned (6.8) and old-growth stands (7.1); however, there was more leaf area in shrubs in the thinned stands. Thinning young Douglas-fir stands will hasten the development of multistory stands by recruitment of conifer regeneration in the understory as well as by enabling the survival of small overstory trees and growth of advanced understory regeneration. Thinning will also help develop the shrub layer by increasing tall shrub stem density and cover of some low shrubs.},

These data layers must permit small area estimates of forest area and, most importantly, provide associated error estimates. This paper presents a model-based approach for coupling mid-resolution satellite imagery with plot-based forest inventory data to produce estimates of probability of forest and associated error at the pixel-level. The proposed Bayesian hierarchical model provides access to each pixel’s posterior predictive distribution allowing for a highly flexible analysis of pixel and multi-pixel areas of interest. The paper presents a trial using multiple dates of Landsat imagery and USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis plot data. The results describe the spatial dependence structure within the trial site, provide pixel and multi-pixel summaries of probability of forest land use, and explore discretization schemes of the posterior predictive distributions to forest and non-forest classes. Model prediction results of a holdout set analysis suggest the proposed model provides high classification accuracy, 88\%, for the trial site.},

	abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.},

Two very simple but effective shrinkage methods and an extension of the nonnegative garrote estimator are introduced. The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines. The procedures are also illustrated analysing data on plasma beta-carotene levels from a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal data refer to the situation where repeated observations are available for each sampled object. Clustered data, where observations are nested in a hierarchical structure within objects (without time necessarily being involved) represent a similar type of situation. Methodologies that take this structure into account allow for the possibilities of systematic differences between objects that are not related to attributes and autocorrelation within objects across time periods. A standard methodology in the statistics literature for this type of data is the mixed effects model, where these differences between objects are represented by so-called “random effects” that are estimated from the data (population-level relationships are termed “fixed effects,” together resulting in a mixed effects model). This paper presents a methodology that combines the structure of mixed effects models for longitudinal and clustered data with the flexibility of tree-based estimation methods. We apply the resulting estimation method, called the RE-EM tree, to pricing in online transactions, showing that the RE-EM tree is less sensitive to parametric assumptions and provides improved predictive power compared to linear models with random effects and regression trees without random effects. We also apply it to a smaller data set examining accident fatalities, and show that the RE-EM tree strongly outperforms a tree without random effects while performing comparably to a linear model with random effects. We also perform extensive simulation experiments to show that the estimator improves predictive performance relative to regression trees without random effects and is comparable or superior to using linear models with random effects in more general situations.},

	abstract = {Stand density index (SDI), although developed for use in even-aged monocultures, has been used for assessing stand density in large-scale forest inventories containing diverse tree species and size distributions. To improve application of SDI in uneven-aged, mixed species stands present in large-scale forest inventories, trends in maximum SDI across diameter classes and species combinations were observed for eight common tree species of the United States. Additionally, the relationship between a stand's mean specific gravity of component trees and maximum SDI was explored. Results indicate that the maximum SDI that any particular species may attain is affected to varying degrees by the species composition of subject stands. A strong relationship was found between the mean specific gravity of all trees in a stand and the 99th percentile of the observed distribution of stand SDI's by classes of mean stand specific gravity. A model is proposed whereby the mean specific gravity of individual trees in a stand may serve as a predictor of a stand's maximum stocking potential, regardless of the stand's diameter distribution and species composition.},

	abstract = {Vertical forest structure can be mapped over large areas by combining samples of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with wall-to-wall spatial data, such as Landsat imagery. Here, we use samples of ALS data and Landsat time-series metrics to produce estimates of top height, basal area, and net stem volume for two timber supply areas near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, using an imputation approach. Both single-year and time series metrics were calculated from annual, gap-free Landsat reflectance composites representing 1984–2014. Metrics included long-term means of vegetation indices, as well as measures of the variance and slope of the indices through time. Terrain metrics, generated from a 30m digital elevation model, were also included as predictors. We found that imputation models improved with the inclusion of Landsat time series metrics when compared to single-year Landsat metrics (relative RMSE decreased from 22.8\% to 16.5\% for top height, from 32.1\% to 23.3\% for basal area, and from 45.6\% to 34.1\% for net stem volume). Landsat metrics that characterized 30-years of stand history resulted in more accurate models (for all three structural attributes) than Landsat metrics that characterized only the most recent 10 or 20years of stand history. To test model transferability, we compared imputed attributes against ALS-based estimates in nearby forest blocks ({\textgreater}150,000ha) that were not included in model training or testing. Landsat-imputed attributes correlated strongly to ALS-based estimates in these blocks (R2=0.62 and relative RMSE=13.1\% for top height, R2=0.75 and relative RMSE=17.8\% for basal area, and R2=0.67 and relative RMSE=26.5\% for net stem volume), indicating model transferability. These findings suggest that in areas containing spatially-limited ALS data acquisitions, imputation models, and Landsat time series and terrain metrics can be effectively used to produce wall-to-wall estimates of key inventory attributes, providing an opportunity to update estimates of forest attributes in areas where inventory information is either out of date or non-existent.},

The methods were applied to a unique dataset originating from different regions of the Alpine Space covering different study areas, forest types, and structures. This is the first benchmark ever performed for different forests within the Alps. The evaluation of the detection results was carried out in a reproducible way by automatically matching them to precise in situ forest inventory data using a restricted nearest neighbor detection approach. Quantitative statistical parameters such as percentages of correctly matched trees and omission and commission errors are presented. The proposed automated matching procedure presented herein shows an overall accuracy of 97\%. Method based analysis, investigations per forest type, and an overall benchmark performance are presented. The best matching rate was obtained for single-layered coniferous forests. Dominated trees were challenging for all methods. The overall performance shows a matching rate of 47\%, which is comparable to results of other benchmarks performed in the past. The study provides new insight regarding the potential and limits of tree detection with ALS and underlines some key aspects regarding the choice of method when performing single tree detection for the various forest types encountered in alpine regions.},

This work concentrates on delineating individual trees in topographically-complex, mixed conifer forest across the California’s Sierra Nevada. We delineated individual trees using vector data and a 3D lidar point cloud segmentation algorithm, and using raster data with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of a canopy height model (CHM). The two approaches are compared to each other and to ground reference data. We used high density (9 pulses/m2), discreet lidar data and WorldView-2 imagery to delineate individual trees, and to classify them by species or species types. We also identified a new method to correct artifacts in a high-resolution CHM. Our main focus was to determine the difference between the two types of approaches and to identify the one that produces more realistic results. We compared the delineations via tree detection, tree heights, and the shape of the generated polygons. The tree height agreement was high between the two approaches and the ground data (r2: 0.93–0.96). Tree detection rates increased for more dominant trees (8–100 percent). The two approaches delineated tree boundaries that differed in shape: the lidar-approach produced fewer, more complex, and larger polygons that more closely resembled real forest structure.},

I applied the methods to 557 plots from the Norwegian National Forest Inventory located in Hedmark County in South East Norway and compared them to the benchmarks methods linear expansion and simulated annealing by studying the individual tree growth predictions before and after PEB correction. Generally, the simulated annealing method seemed to improve growth prediction most and overall the existing methods performed better than those based on ALS. All PEB-correction methods tested gave minor changes in growth predictions and the absolute change in percent in adj. R2 and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was numerically small, with an average percentage change for the tested CIs between 1.8 for adj. R2 and 0.6 for AIC of the observed values in the original data. The small differences in the results between the original data and the PEB-corrected data show that on average PEB remains a minor problem for individual tree growth prediction. Whether the results are valid for forests with significantly different spatial composition than that of this database remains to be confirmed.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the quantification of competition by local neighbors and its influence on individual tree growth. The effect of local neighbors is usually expressed by a mathematical formulation – commonly referred to as a “competition index” – representing how much each tree is affected by its neighbors. Competition indices are of two general types: (i) distance independent or non-spatially explicit, and (ii) distance-dependent or spatially explicit, depending on whether or not tree coordinate locations are required for their computation. An index of individual tree competition is a central component of individual-tree growth and yield models (Chaps. 14 and 15). Two major components of development of distance-dependent indices, namely selection of competitors and formulation of the competition index, are discussed in depth. A wide array of competition indices have been developed and no single index or class of indices has been found to be universally superior. Evaluation and comparison of competition indices for growth and yield prediction, along with suggestions for future refinement and improvement of competition measures, provide a conclusion to the chapter.},

This paper investigates whether and under what circumstances edge-correction methods are necessary and evaluates the performance of six different approaches: no edge correction, translation, reflection, buffer zone, and two new nearest-neighbour methods. The performance of edge-correction methods depends strongly on the algorithmic structure of the indices and the spatial pattern of tree positions involved. Some edge-correction methods introduce more error than ignoring edge bias altogether.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales is a critical component of ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity. In frequent-fire pine and mixed conifer forests in the western US, pre-settlement era forests were complex mosaics of individual trees, tree clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that restoration treatments should seek to restore these mosaic patterns as these reference forests were adapted to frequent-fire and shifting climatic conditions. Yet, methods to quantify and incorporate spatial reference information into restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate change. In this dissertation, I develop a new set of spatial metrics to quantify within-stand pattern in terms of widely spaced individual trees, tree clumps, and openings (ICO). Within 0.5 ha tree neighborhoods, I found evidence that a definable range and distribution, or envelope, of pattern and structure was present. This envelope ranged from low density patterns with few clumps and high opening levels, to patterns with a mid-range of density and varying levels of clumping, to high density, highly clumped patterns. The envelope was constrained by an upper limit of clump size, maximum density levels well below site potential, and the presence of at least some clumping in all plots. Across 3 x 6ha plots, tree neighborhood patterns of clumps and openings were spatially dependent. Aggregations of large clumps formed sub-patches that occupied 7-16\% of plot area. A gradient of low to moderate density with low levels of clumping was found on the remainder. A silvicultural approach to translating reference patterns into restoration prescriptions and monitoring protocols was also developed and applied in a case study. Treatments using this ICO approach resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the range of reference envelopes. I also developed a method based on climatic water balance parameters, downscaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate and identify climate analogue reference conditions.},

This is because trees in close proximity compete for resources and space to enable growth. In this paper, the position of trees, tree height (LH), tree crown radius (LCR), and growth competition index (LCI) were extracted from a light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR)-based rasterized canopy height model using the multilevel morphological active-contour algorithm. The diameter and volume of individual trees are tested and validated to be an exponential function of those LiDAR-derived tree parameters. The best LiDAR-based diameter estimation model and volume estimation model were tested as significant with an R2 value of 0.84 and 0.9 and evaluated with an estimation bias of 8.7 cm and 0.91 m3, respectively. Results also showed that LH and LCR are positively related to the LiDAR-derived diameter at breast height (DBH) and the LiDAR-derived volume of individual trees in a forest stand, whereas LCI is negatively related. The proposed algorithm of individual tree volume estimation was further applied to predict the volume of three sample plots in mountainous forest stands. It was found that the LVM could be used to predict an acceptable volume estimate of old-aged forest stands. The estimation bias, i.e., percentage RMSE (RMSE\%), is averaged at around 4\% using the LiDAR metrics lnLH, LCI, and LCR, whereas the RMSE\% increases to 50\% if only lnLH is applied. Results suggest that LCI is an important regulation factor in the estimation of forest volume stocks using LiDAR remote sensing.},

In this paper, we want to test whether computationally demanding competition indices outperform traditional indices in predicting mean basal area increment. The study was undertaken in old, uneven-aged black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) stands in northeastern Quebec, Canada. The predictability of individual tree growth rates was related to crown dimensions and other stand and tree variables measured in the field.

Many indices dealing with aboveground interference use geometric standard crown shapes to quantify the competitive strength of neighbors on the target tree. As such crowns do not realistically represent the spatial heterogeneity in the canopy, a terrestrial laser scanner was used to gain detailed information on crown characteristics which may be used for a more precise modeling of the relationship between competition and growth. We examined groups of 5 trees growing in three major geographic regions of Germany to investigate the effect of intra- and interspecific competition for light on basal area growth of target beech trees (Fagus sylvatica). A competition index based on individual crown shapes derived from TLS-data correlated better with target tree growth than an index using conventional geometric crown shape models. Both measures ascribed the highest competitive strength to intraspecific competition. In contrast to the valuable hardwoods for which a slightly lower crown competition was calculated, the conifer species Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) had considerably weaker competitive effects on beech. The growth response of the investigated target trees reflected the strength in competition (highest relative basal area growth of beech if mixed with Scots pine{\textgreater}Norway spruce{\textgreater}valuable hardwoods{\textgreater}intraspecific competition) even though the increment measurements with self-acting dendrometers covered only one vegetation period. Neighborhood diversity and target tree growth were correlated, indicating stronger effects of intra- compared to interspecific interference. The utilization of a terrestrial laser scanner provided insights into canopy structure of the competitive neighborhood that may enhance our understanding of competitive interactions.},

Nearest-neighbor (NN) methods are generally used to assess whether objects are arranged at random or in a deterministic manner. Simple standard NN techniques, however, may fail to identify complex spatial organizations. To overcome this problem the present study proposes a NN iterative algorithm that enables deterministic spatial patterns to be detected by identifying the distances between objects for which there is the greatest deviation from randomness and hence the amplitude of the areas of maximum reciprocal influence between objects. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by applying it to both manufactured and experimental data. The manufactured data example showed that the proposed procedure produced neither false positives or negatives. The method proved to be extremely sensitive, detecting even small deviations from randomness. The experimental analysis was applied to the study of the spatial distribution of apoptotic structures in malignant neoplastic tissue. It showed that the apoptotic cells and bodies are characterized by a complex spatial pattern, and aggregate closely.},

We present a methodology to retrieve and map forest canopy fuel and other forest structural parameters using small-footprint full-waveform airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Full-waveform LiDAR sensors register the complete returned backscattered signal through time and can describe physical properties of the intercepted objects. This study was undertaken in a mixed forest dominated by Douglas-fir, occasionally mixed with other conifers, in north-west Oregon (United States). We extracted two sets of LiDAR metrics using pulse detection and waveform modelling and then constructed several predictive models using forward stepwise multiple linear regression. The resulting models explained {\textasciitilde}80\% of the variability for many of the canopy fuel and forest structure parameters: aboveground biomass (R2=0.84), quadratic mean diameter (R2=0.82), canopy height (R2=0.79), canopy base height (R2=0.78) and canopy fuel load (R2=0.79). The lowest performing models included basal area (R2=0.76), stand volume (R2=0.73), canopy bulk density (R2=0.67) and stand density index (R2=0.66). Our results indicate that full-waveform LiDAR systems show promise in systematically characterising the structure and canopy fuel loads of forests, which may enable accurate fire behaviour forecasting that in turn supports the development of prevention and planning policies.},

	abstract = {A plethora of information contained in full-waveform (FW) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data offers prospects for characterizing vegetation structures. This study aims to investigate the capacity of FW LiDAR data alone for tree species identification through the integration of waveform metrics with machine learning methods and Bayesian inference. Specifically, we first conducted automatic tree segmentation based on the waveform-based canopy height model (CHM) using three approaches including TreeVaW, watershed algorithms and the combination of TreeVaW and watershed (TW) algorithms. Subsequently, the Random forests (RF) and Conditional inference forests (CF) models were employed to identify important tree-level waveform metrics derived from three distinct sources, such as raw waveforms, composite waveforms, the waveform-based point cloud and the combined variables from these three sources. Further, we discriminated tree (gray pine, blue oak, interior live oak) and shrub species through the RF, CF and Bayesian multinomial logistic regression (BMLR) using important waveform metrics identified in this study. Results of the tree segmentation demonstrated that the TW algorithms outperformed other algorithms for delineating individual tree crowns. The CF model overcomes waveform metrics selection bias caused by the RF model which favors correlated metrics and enhances the accuracy of subsequent classification. We also found that composite waveforms are more informative than raw waveforms and waveform-based point cloud for characterizing tree species in our study area. Both classical machine learning methods (the RF and CF) and the BMLR generated satisfactory average overall accuracy (74\% for the RF, 77\% for the CF and 81\% for the BMLR) and the BMLR slightly outperformed the other two methods. However, these three methods suffered from low individual classification accuracy for the blue oak which is prone to being misclassified as the interior live oak due to the similar characteristics of blue oak and interior live oak. Uncertainty estimates from the BMLR method compensate for this downside by providing classification results in a probabilistic sense and rendering users with more confidence in interpreting and applying classification results to real-world tasks such as forest inventory. Overall, this study recommends the CF method for feature selection and suggests that BMLR could be a superior alternative to classical machining learning methods.},

	volume = {47},
	abstract = {Background
Two indices, the 300 Index and Site Index, are commonly used to quantify productivity of Pinus radiata D.Don within New Zealand. Although maps of these indices exist, availability of new data and modifications to underlying models makes a refit of these prediction surfaces desirable. Prediction errors of such surfaces have only been reported at a plot-level scale, but their application is invariably at a larger scale where prediction accuracy should be better. The objectives of this study were to: (i) develop updated predictive surfaces for the 300 Index and Site Index; and (ii) characterise the relationship between prediction error and spatial scale for both surfaces. Methods
Models were developed using a dataset of 4108 permanent sample plots from throughout New Zealand. Productivity indices were estimated from plot measurements and environmental variables extracted for each plot. Data were randomly split into fitting and validation datasets and surfaces developed from the fitting dataset for the 300 Index and Site Index using partial least squares regression, ordinary kriging and regression kriging. Prediction accuracy across a range of scales from 0.2 to 200 km was evaluated using the validation dataset. ResultsRegression kriging was found to be the most accurate method for describing spatial variation in the 300 Index and Site Index across New Zealand. Examination of changes in prediction error with spatial scale demonstrated a gradual decline in error from the plot level with increasing scale. Conclusions
This study provides accurate maps of both the 300 Index and Site Index across New Zealand. Analysis of the effects of scale on prediction accuracy indicates that 95\% confidence intervals of predictions for the 300 Index based on these maps averaged over an area of about 700 ha are half those of plot-level predictions and halve again at a scale of about 20,000 ha. For the Site Index, the improvement in precision with increasing scale is more gradual with 95\% confidence intervals halving at a scale of about 20,000 ha and halving again at a scale of about 250,000 ha.},

The aim of the study was to compare inventories of basal area, dominant height and number of trees per hectare based on photo-interpretation and laser scanning from two sites in Norway by means of cost-plus-loss analyses. In general, more precise estimates were found for laser scanning than for photo-interpretation, while the biases were about equally distributed between the two methods. On average for the two sites, the inventory costs, NPV losses and total costs for photo-interpretation were about 6, 49 and 54 euros ha−1, respectively, while they were 11, 13 and 25 euros ha−1 for laser scanning. The data used for the comparison were limited to two sites and 77 stands, and certain simplifying assumptions were made in the cost-plus-loss analyses. Still, there is reason to believe that the results of the study are of general validity with respect to the main conclusion when comparing the two methods.},

The density-dependent whole-stand model was specified for all relevant Finnish Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

Sensitivity analysis showed that in some cases and owing to endogenous thinnings the optimal rotation length may increase with the rate of interest and site fertility, and decrease with harvesting cost. The number of thinnings is more sensitive to changes in the rate of interest, logging conditions and site productivity for Scots pine stands than for Norway spruce stands. Economic optimization suggests that for both species the first thinning should be performed later than officially recommended. The last thinning should be heavier than officially recommended, especially at high rates of interest. This increases the optimal rotation length compared with solutions under restricted thinning intensity.},

In addition to this height information, we use height texture (variation in height), intensity (amplitude of lidar response), and multiple (two) returns from lidar to classify the data. Furthermore, we have used luminance (measured in the visible spectrum) from aerial imagery as the fifth feature for classification. We have used mixture of Gaussian models for modeling the training data. Model parameters and the posterior probabilities are estimated using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We have experimented with different number of components per model and found that four components per model yield satisfactory results.

The latest terrestrial lidar sensors record intensity and echo information for each pulse in addition to range. In this study, lidar height and intensity data were used to classify land cover using an object-oriented approach. The study area was selected based on the variety of land cover types present and consists of urban, mixed forest, and wetland-estuary coastal environments. Surfaces constructed from the lidar points included DSM, DEM, intensity, multiple echos, and normalized height. These surfaces were segmented and classified using object rule based classification. Ten classes were extracted from the lidar data, including saturated and non-saturated intertidal sediments, saturated or stressed and lush ground cover vegetation, low and tall deciduous and coniferous trees, roads and bare soil, bright-roofed structures, dark-roofed structures, and water. The accuracy of the classification was assessed using independent ground reference polygons interpreted from colour orthophotographs and intensity images. The average accuracy of the 10 classes was 94\%, but improved to 98\% when the classification results were aggregated into seven classes. The results indicate that accurate land cover maps can be generated from a single lidar survey using the derived surfaces, and that image object segmentation and rule-based classification techniques allow the exploitation of spectral and spatial attributes of the lidar data.},

Elevation and intensity airborne LiDAR data are used in this study in order to classify forest and ground types quickly and efficiently without the need for manipulating multispectral image files, using a supervised object-orientated approach. LiDAR has the advantage of being able to create elevation surfaces that are in 3D, while also having information on LiDAR intensity values, thus it is a spatial and spectral segmentation tool. This classification method also uses point distribution frequency criteria to differentiate between land cover types. Classifications were performed using two methods, one that included the influence of the ground in heavily vegetated areas, and the other which eliminated the ground points before classification. The classification of three meanders of the Garonne and Allier rivers in France has demonstrated overall classification accuracies of 95\% and 94\% for the methods including and excluding the ground influence respectively. Five types of riparian forest were classified with accuracies between 66 and 98\%. These forest types included planted and natural forest stands of different ages. Classifications of short vegetation and bare earth also produced high accuracies averaging above 90\%.},

In greater detail, we present: 1) an advanced system for the joint use of hyperspectral and LIDAR data in complex classification problems; 2) an investigation on the effectiveness of the very promising support vector machines (SVMs) and Gaussian maximum likelihood with leave-one-out-covariance algorithm classifiers for the analysis of complex forest scenarios characterized from a high number of species in a multisource framework; and 3) an analysis on the effectiveness of different LIDAR returns and channels (elevation and intensity) for increasing the classification accuracy obtained with hyperspectral images, particularly in relation to the discrimination of very similar classes. Several experiments carried out on a complex forest area in Italy provide interesting conclusions on the effectiveness and potentialities of the joint use of hyperspectral and LIDAR data and on the accuracy of the different classification techniques analyzed in the proposed system. In particular, the elevation channel of the first LIDAR return was very effective for the separation of species with similar spectral signatures but different mean heights, and the SVM classifier proved to be very robust and accurate in the exploitation of the considered multisource data.},

The 12 percentiles were derived from the empirical basal area distributions of 141 plots with size 300–400 m2. Regression analysis was used to relate the percentiles to various canopy height and canopy density metrics derived from the laser data. On average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality. The stratum-specific regressions explained 7–91\% of the variability. Total plot volume predicted from the estimated distributions was used to assess the accuracy of the regressions. Cross-validation of the regressions revealed a bias of −1.2 to 2.1\% between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume. The standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of plot volume were 15.1–16.4\%. Neither bias nor standard deviation differed significantly between the two validated methods.},

	abstract = {The Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NNFI) provides estimates of forest parameters on national and regional scales by means of a systematic network of permanent sample plots. One of the biggest challenges for the NNFI is the interest in forest attribute information for small sub-populations such as municipalities or protected areas. Frequently, too few sampled observations are available for such small areas to allow estimates with acceptable precision. However, if an auxiliary variable exists that is correlated with the variable of interest, small area estimation (SAE) techniques may provide means to improve the precision of estimates. The study aimed at estimating the mean above-ground forest biomass for small areas with high precision and accuracy, using SAE techniques. For this purpose, the simple random sampling (SRS) estimator, the generalized regression (GREG) estimator, and the unit-level empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator were compared. Mean canopy height obtained from a photogrammetric canopy height model (CHM) was the auxiliary variable available for every population element. The small areas were 14 municipalities within a 2,184 km2 study area for which an estimate of the mean forest biomass was sought. The municipalities were between 31 and 527 km2 and contained 1–35 NNFI sample plots located within forest. The mean canopy height obtained from the CHM was found to have a strong linear correlation with forest biomass. Both the SRS estimator and the GREG estimator result in unstable estimates if they are based on too few observations. Although this is not the case for the EBLUP estimator, the estimators were only compared for municipalities with more than five sample plots. The SRS resulted in the highest standard errors in all municipalities. Whereas the GREG and EBLUP standard errors were similar for small areas with many sample plots, the EBLUP standard error was usually smaller than the GREG standard error. The difference between the EBLUP and GREG standard error increased with a decreasing number of sample plots within the small area. The EBLUP estimates of mean forest biomass within the municipalities ranged between 95.01 and 153.76 Mg ha−1, with standard errors between 8.20 and 12.84 Mg ha−1.},

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using small footprint lidar to map boreal canopy gaps of sizes ranging from a few square meters to several hectares. Two co-registered canopy height models (CHMs) of optimal resolution were created from lidar datasets acquired respectively in 1998 and 2003. Canopy gaps were automatically delineated using an object-based technique with an accuracy of 96\%. Further, combinatorics was applied on the two CHMs and the delineated gaps to provide information on the area of old and new gaps, gap expansions, new random gap openings, gap closure due to lateral growth of adjacent vegetation or due to vertical growth of regeneration. The results obtained establish lidar as an excellent tool for rapidly acquiring detailed and spatially extensive short-term dynamics of canopy gaps.},

Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options.},

	abstract = {A methodological framework for spatial prediction based on regression-kriging is described and compared with ordinary kriging and plain regression. The data are first transformed using logit transformation for target variables and factor analysis for continuous predictors (auxiliary maps). The target variables are then fitted using step-wise regression and residuals interpolated using kriging. A generic visualisation method is used to simultaneously display predictions and associated uncertainty. The framework was tested using 135 profile observations from the national survey in Croatia, divided into interpolation (100) and validation sets (35). Three target variables: organic matter, pH in topsoil and topsoil thickness were predicted from six relief parameters and nine soil mapping units. Prediction efficiency was evaluated using the mean error and root mean square error (RMSE) of prediction at validation points. The results show that the proposed framework improves efficiency of predictions. Moreover, it ensured normality of residuals and enforced prediction values to be within the physical range of a variable. For organic matter, it achieved lower relative RMSE than ordinary kriging (53.3\% versus 66.5\%). For topsoil thickness, it achieved a lower relative RMSE (66.5\% versus 83.3\%) and a lower bias than ordinary kriging (0.15 versus 0.69 cm). The prediction of pH in topsoil was difficult with all three methods. This framework can adopt both continuous and categorical soil variables in a semi-automated or automated manner. It opens a possibility to develop a bundle algorithm that can be implemented in a GIS to interpolate soil profile data from existing datasets.},

	abstract = {Functioning lasers were first demonstrated in 1960 in the United States and in 1961 in Canada and in the Soviet Union, but research into the use of lasers as forest measurement tools did not begin for another 15 years. Initially, with respect to Earth resources, lasers were employed to measure sea ice surface roughness, to make near-shore bathymetric measurements, to penetrate forests to make detailed topographic measurements, and to fluoresce oceanic phytoplankton for surface current studies. Some of these early studies noted that forest profiles were evident but in fact added noise to topographic retrievals. As early as 1964, researchers noted vegetation returns acquired using an airborne helium–neon (He–Ne), 0.63 μm, continuous wave (CW) laser. A decade and many airborne studies later, scientists with TRANARG, a mapping and surveying company in Caracas, Venezuela, reported on flights undertaken in 1976 that utilized a He–Ne lidar to collect over 11000 km of lidar profiles, spaced 1.5 km apart, to construct a topographic map to help site a new reservoir. Though they depended on the laser to penetrate vegetation, they noted 35–40 m median canopy heights with emergents up to 55 m in their profiles. Trees came to be regarded as a signal rather than noise in the mid-1970s. In 1976 in the Soviet Union, Russian researchers felled a birch and a spruce, aimed a He–Ne CW laser with a spot size of approximately 25 mm at the horizontal trees, produced a profilograph, compared it with tape measurements, and concluded that, with increased power, such a laser could be mounted on an aircraft to remotely measure forest canopies. In 1979, they mounted their He–Ne laser on an AN-2 biplane and acquired their first airborne profiles. These studies and others done prior to 1985, i.e., the first two decades of airborne laser research, are reviewed in this glance backwards at the history of forestry lidar.},

The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout a 1000-ha study area, and the size of each plot was 200 m2. On the average, the distance between transmitted laser pulses was 0.9 m on the ground. The plots were divided into three strata according to age class and site quality.

A proposed practical two-stage procedure for prediction of corresponding characteristics of entire forest stands was tested. Sixty-one stands within the study area, with an average size of 1.6 ha each, were divided into 200 m2 regular grid cells. The six examined characteristics were predicted for each grid cell from the corresponding laser data utilizing the estimated regression equations. Average values for each stand was computed.

	abstract = {The Levels-of-Growing-Stock Studies in Douglas-fir is a regional cooperative to investigate the effects of levels of growing stock on young stand growth. The Hoskins
installation, in western Oregon, was established in a dense, high site natural stand at total age 20 years. The initial thinning resulted in an immediate 131 percent
increase in diameter growth. Subsequent crown type thinning treatments retained eight different, predetermined percentages of the gross basal area growth on the control plots. At age 45, diameter growth remains strong on the heavily thinned treatments, but decreases with increased growing stock. Gross volume growth increased with growing stock, while gross basal area growth was much less influenced by growing stock. Volume growth was strongly related to
density because of the rapid height growth of this young stand. Heavy thinnings reduced volume production because of the depletion of growing stock. Total volume production was only slightly reduced on the light
thinnings, whereas merchantable volume was greater than the unthinned control. Mortality was heavy on the control, but negligible on the treated plots. Heavy
mortality in the last period, reduced net volume growth on the control to less than the treatments. Periodic annual increment (PAI) for cubic foot volume appear to have culminated for the treatments, although they are nearly twice the mean annual increments on the thinned plots. Board foot volume PAI does not appear to have culminated for any of the treatments. The diameter growth of individual trees was particularly influenced by the amount of density in trees larger than any given tree. Density had only a minor effect on height growth. Trees in lower densities had longer crowns and greater
taper. Results from simulations of alternative thinning regimes show the desirability of early thinnings. Compared to
thinning from below, crown thinning appeared to give the greatest release to the residual stand and produce high volume growth. Management must consider the trade-off s
between greater diameter growth at low densities and greater volume growth at high densities.},

	abstract = {Commercial thinning has the potential to increase structural diversity in managed conifer stands and redirect development of young stands towards structure characteristic of late-seral habitats. Thinning to increase diversity, however, is likely to require different strategies than thinning to maximize timber production. To prescribe thinning regimes that will promote diversity, managers need more information on response of wildlife to a range of thinning intensities and patterns. We studied the response of forest songbirds to three different intensities and patterns of thinning in 40-year-old stands dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the Oregon Cascades. We estimated densities of songbirds for 2 years before and 4 years after experimental thinning with standard point count methodology. We compared changes in density before and after thinning between each thinning treatment and the control with repeated measures analysis of variance. Thinning increased species richness and the density of 10 species. Furthermore, the frequency of detection of four additional species increased in thinned stands. Thinning decreased the density of five species, but no species was excluded by thinning. Our results were largely consistent with those from other studies of bird response to thinning from different regions of the Pacific Northwest. We conclude that commercial thinning rapidly promotes diversity of breeding songbirds in young, conifer-dominated stands. However, we suggest using a variety of thinning intensities and patterns, ranging from no thinning to very widely spaced residual trees, in order to maximize avian diversity at the landscape scale and structural diversity both within and among stands.},

	abstract = {Because of fires and intensive logging practices, young forest stands dominate much of the landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Most young stands were reforested with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menzeisii) trees at high densities. Researchers have proposed thinning of the densely stocked young stands as a means to improve habitats for vertebrates. However, effects of thinning intensity on forest-floor small mammals are not well understood. During 1994-1996, we conducted experimental and retrospective studies using pitfall trapping to assess effects of thinning intensity on abundance and reproduction of small mammals in Douglas-fir forests of the Oregon Coast Range, USA. In the experimental study, we assessed the short-term effects of thinning stands to moderate and to low tree densities on small mammals during the first 2 years following thinning. In the retrospective study, we assessed potential long-term effects of thinning by comparing relative abundance and reproductive performance of small mammals in previously thinned (7-24 years prior to the study) and unthinned stands. Among the 12 species of small mammals we examined in the experimental study, number of captures increased for 4 species and decreased for 1 within 2 years of thinning. However, responses were similar between moderately and heavily thinned stands. Among the 9 species we examined in the retrospective study, number of captures was greater for 5 species and lower for none in previously thinned than in unthinned stands. Furthermore, total number of small mammals captured was higher in previously thinned than in unthinned stands. Effects of thinning on 2 species, creeping voles (Microtus oregoni) and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus), were consistent in the short and long term. The number of captures for both species increased in the first 2 years following thinning and was greater in stands thinned 7-24 years previously than unthinned stands. Number of western red-backed voles (Clethrionomys californicus) captured decreased within 2 years of thinning but was similar in stands thinned 7-24 years previously and in unthinned stands. Reproductive performances of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and creeping voles improved following thinning in the short term. In the retrospective study, reproductive performance of western red-backed voles was higher in thinned than in unthinned stands. Overall, thinning did not have substantial detrimental effects on any of the species we investigated and had positive effects on several. We suggest that thinning is a viable option to enhance habitat quality for several species of forest-floor small mammals in densely stocked, young Douglas-fir stands.},

	abstract = {This study investigated how lidar-derived vegetation indices, disturbance history from Landsat time series (LTS) imagery, plot location accuracy, and plot size influenced accuracy of statistical spatial models (nearest-neighbor imputation maps) of forest vegetation composition and structure. Nearest-neighbor (NN) imputation maps were developed for 539,000 ha in the central Oregon Cascades, USA. Mapped explanatory data included tasseled-cap indices and disturbance history metrics (year, magnitude, and duration of disturbance) from LTS imagery, lidar-derived vegetation metrics, climate, topography, and soil parent material. Vegetation data from USDA Forest Service forest inventory plots was summarized at two plot sizes (plot and subplot) and geographically located with two levels of accuracy (standard and improved). Maps of vegetation composition and structure were developed with the Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) method of NN imputation using different combinations of explanatory variables, plot spatial resolution, and plot positional accuracy. Lidar vegetation indices greatly improved predictions of live tree structure, moderately improved predictions of snag density and down wood volume, but did not consistently improve species predictions. LTS disturbance metrics improved predictions of forest structure, but not to the degree of lidar indices, while also improving predictions of many species. Absence of disturbance attribution (i.e. disturbance type such as fire or timber harvest) in LTS disturbance metrics may have limited our ability to predict forest structure. Absence of corrected lidar intensity values may also have lowered accuracy of snag and species predictions. However, LTS disturbance attribution and lidar corrected intensity values may not be able to overcome fundamental limitations of remote sensing for predicting snags and down wood that are obscured by the forest canopy. Improved GPS plot locations had little influence on map accuracy, and we suggest under what conditions improved GPS plot locations may or may not improve the accuracy of predictive maps that link remote sensing with forest inventory plots. Subplot NN imputation maps had much lower accuracy compared to maps generated using response variables from larger whole plots. No single map had optimal results for every mapped variable, suggesting map users and developers need to prioritize what forest vegetation attributes are most important for any given map application.},

	abstract = {Vegetation structure quantified by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can improve understanding of wildlife occupancy and species-richness patterns. However, there is often a time lag between the collection of LiDAR data and wildlife data. We investigated whether a time lag between the LiDAR acquisition and field-data acquisition affected mapped wildlife distributions ranging from an individual species distribution to total avian species richness in a conifer forest. We collected bird and LiDAR data in 2009 across a 20,000 ha forest in northern Idaho. Using the 2009 LiDAR data, we modelled the probability of occurrence for the brown creeper (Certhia americana). Using the same 2009 LiDAR data, we additionally modelled total avian species richness and richness of three different bird nesting guilds (ground/understory, mid/upper canopy and cavity). We mapped brown creeper occupancy probability and species richness using the 2009 models, and then compared these maps with maps based on the same models applied to a 2003-LiDAR dataset. A prior study identified areas harvested between 2003 and 2009. There was on average a 5\% absolute decrease in mapped probabilities of brown creeper occurrence in non-harvest areas between 2003 and 2009. Species richness changed by less than one species in all cases within non-harvest areas between the 2003 and 2009 maps. Although these comparisons were statistically significant at the p {\textless} 0.0001 level, it is likely that the high number of map cells ( 480,000) influenced this result. Similar patterns between our 2003 and 2009 maps in non-harvest areas for this suite of avian responses suggests that a 6-year difference between field-data collection and LiDAR-data collection has a minimal effect on mapped avian patterns in an undisturbed coniferous forest. However, because this is one case study in one ecosystem, additional work examining the effect of temporal lags between LiDAR and field-data collection on mapping wildlife distributions is warranted in additional ecosystems.},

We used Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer  satellite data to delineate the top layer of frozen soils. SMMR is a passive microwave sensor having five channels  with a horizontal and vertical polarization. SMRR data are available between 1978-1987 with noon and midnight overpass and footprint sizes between 25 km and 150 km. SMMR data were processed from resampled 1/4 degree grid cells during fall freeze-up and spring thaw . The dielectric properties of a target may directly affect the satellite signal. The dielectric value is an order of magnitude smaller for frozen soil water. There are other significant changes to the emitted microwave signal from changes to the surface physical temperature, attenuation of the soil signal from plant water and soil moisture. We further characterized the temporal and spatial dynamic of frozen soils using the FroST  simulation model. The FroST model was used to further predict soil water and ice content, and soil temperature. SMMR results were compared versus 5-cm soil temperature data from available weather stations . SMMR data were analyzed as a function of frequency, polarization, polarization difference, and "frequency gradient". In addition, vegetation density, physical temperature and snow depth were also considered. Preliminary analysis of SMMR derived frozen soil/thaw classification using a simple threshold classification indicates a mean overall classification accuracy by season of 85 percent. A sensitivity analysis for different soils with varying amounts of snow was conducted with FroST, which showed that the amount of snow, and the time of snow fall and melt affected the ice and water content, and depth of thaw. These results indicate a potential source of flooding and erosion under conditions when melting snow and spring rains provide a source of infiltrating water.},

	abstract = {Two basic microwave approaches are used to measure soil moisture, one is passive which is based on radiometry and the other is active and uses radar. Both approaches utilize the large contrast between the dielectric constant of dry soil and water. A total backscattering amount for a vegetated surface include volume, surface, and surface-volume interaction scattering terms. The backscattering model here is based on without surface-volume interaction scattering terms. In attempt to use active microwave remote sensors in estimation of soil moisture, two major problems, effects of surface roughness and vegetation cover, are faced. For a given sensor, we assume the roughness under the condition of no change during data acquisitions. The main problem for retrieval of surface dielectric properties is separate the volume scattering item from total backscattering. With the time-serial soil moisture map from L band passive microwave radiometry, the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) at Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97), we calculated the surface reflectivity with 800 m resolution. The volume scattering items at 800 m resolution can be derived using multi-temporal resample calibration Radarsat SAR and surface reflectivity data. Weighting the ratio of NDVI at different resolution from NOAA/AVHRR and TM, the surface reflectivity change with 50 m resolution can be estimated according to the total backscattering and volume scattering, then soil moisture change be mapped at 50 m resolution.},

Angular canopy closure (ACC) is the proportion of covered sky at some angular range around the zenith, and can be measured with a field-of-view instrument, such as a camera. We compared field-measured VCC and ACC at 15° and 75° from the zenith to different LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) metrics, using several LiDAR data sets and comprehensive field data. The VCC was estimated to a high precision using a simple proportion of canopy points in first-return data. Confining to a maximum 15° scan zenith angle, the absolute root mean squared error (RMSE) was 3.7–7.0\%, with an overestimation of 3.1–4.6\%. We showed that grid-based methods are capable of reducing the inherent overestimation of VCC. The low scan angles and low power settings that are typically applied in topographic LiDARs are not suitable for ACC estimation as they measure in wrong geometry and cannot easily detect small within-crown gaps. However, ACC at 0–15° zenith angles could be estimated from LiDAR data with sufficient precision, using also the last returns (RMSE 8.1–11.3\%, bias –6.1–+4.6\%). The dependency of LiDAR metrics and ACC at 0–75° zenith angles was nonlinear and was modeled from laser pulse proportions with nonlinear regression with a best-case standard error of 4.1\%. We also estimated leaf area index from the LiDAR metrics with linear regression with a standard error of 0.38. The results show that correlations between airborne laser metrics and different canopy field characteristics are very high if the field measurements are done with equivalent accuracy.},

Such models, however, are not suitable when the target variable exhibits a point mass at zero, a highly skewed distribution of the nonzero values and a strong spatial structure. In this paper, a SAE approach for dealing with such variables is suggested. We propose a two-part random effects SAE model that includes a correlation structure on the area random effects that appears in the two parts and incorporates a bivariate smooth function of the geographical coordinates of units. To account for the skewness of the distribution of the positive values of the response variable, a Gamma model is adopted. To fit the model, to get small area estimates and to evaluate their precision, a hierarchical Bayesian approach is used. The study is motivated by a real SAE problem. We focus on estimation of the per-farm average grape wine production in Tuscany, at subregional level, using the Farm Structure Survey data. Results from this real data application and those obtained by a model-based simulation experiment show a satisfactory performance of the suggested SAE approach.},

We provide two necessary and sufficient conditions for these estimators to be asymptotically efficient. It is an interesting consequence of our results that when the number of lags used to define the estimators is chosen to be equal to the number of variogram parameters to be estimated, the ordinary least squares estimator, the weighted least squares and the generalized least squares estimators are all asymptotically efficient.},

	abstract = {Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies. However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers, are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is that structured data also provides ample opportunity for overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation, where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that, for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such correlations.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is an important issue in the support of any forestry decision. Forestry decision making today typically involves objectives and information concerning ecological, economic and social issues. The consequences of alternative forest management programmes might be hard to assess, and predictions and assessments always include uncertainty. Forestry decisions also often concern large areas, long time horizons and multiple stakeholders, which further complicates forest management planning and increases uncertainty involved in it. This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. The aim is to provide readers with an overview of alternative approach for coping with uncertainty, especially from the viewpoint of forestry and natural resource management applications. Generally taken, there are two main conventional approaches, namely classical (frequentist) and Bayesian probability theory. These lead to either classical or Bayesian decision theory, respectively. In addition, uncertainty can be dealt with, for instance, using the fuzzy set theory. This theory mostly deals with uncertainty due to the ambiguity of concepts. So far, in decision support tools, probability and fuzzy set theory are the most common approaches. However, the possibility theory and the evidence theory, for instance, can also be relied upon when managing uncertainty. These theories deal with subjective beliefs and expert judgements. They are able to deal with partial information and pure ignorance. The counterparts to the classical decision rules based on these theories are presented, as well as some decision support methods designed using the approaches presented. Because of the manifold sources of uncertainty, all these approaches can have application in the support of forestry decisions.},

	abstract = {Complete coverage of the prediction approach to survey sampling in a single resource  Prediction theory has been extremely influential in survey sampling for nearly three decades, yet research findings on this model-based approach are scattered in disparate areas of the statistical literature. Finite Population Sampling and Inference: A Prediction Approach presents for the first time a unified treatment of sample design and estimation for finite populations from a prediction point of view, providing readers with access to a wealth of theoretical results, including many new results and, a variety of practical applications. Geared to theoretical statisticians and practitioners alike, the book discusses all topics from the ground up and clearly explains the relation of the prediction approach to the traditional design-based randomization approach. Key features include: * Special emphasis on linking survey sampling to mainstream statistics through extensive use of general linear models * A liberal use of simulation studies, numerical examples, and exercises illustrating theoretical results * Numerous statistical graphics showing simulation results and properties of estimates * A library of S-Plus computer functions plus six real populations, available via ftp * Over 260 references to finite population sampling, linear models, and other relevant literature},

	title = {The {Impact} of {Measurement} {Error} in {Auxiliary} {Variables} on {Model}-{Based} {Estimation} of {Finite} {Population} {Totals}: {A} {Simulation} {Study}},
	abstract = {Model-based prediction theory for finite population sampling and inference (Valliant et al., 2000) largely assumes that auxiliary variables are available for all units in the target population. These auxiliary variables play many important roles in prediction theory: they are used to 1) select samples balanced on the auxiliary variables that, when combined with (theoretically) appropriate prediction models based on the auxiliary variables, produce bias-robust estimators of population totals with minimum variance; 2) fit models to sample data which enable making predictions for non-sample cases based on the sample observations; and 3) ultimately make predictions on key survey variables for nonsample units and compute appropriate model-based standard errors for estimated totals based on the predictions. Error-free measurement of the auxiliary variables on the population frame would thus seem critical for making appropriate finite population inferences. Unfortunately, there has been very little research examining the impact of measurement error in the auxiliary variables on the properties of these model-based estimators. This simulation study empirically examines the properties of selected modelbased estimators of finite population totals when available auxiliary variables are measured with varying levels of error, and assesses the impact of the measurement error on theoretical expectations for the estimators. Increased variance in measurement errors is shown to increase both the bias and variance of selected model-based estimators, and simulation results show that careful attention to the selection of samples with weighted balance on reasonable powers of the auxiliary variable, as described in Valliant et al. (2000), provides protection against the bias that can be introduced by measurement error in unbalanced samples and maximizes efficiency among competing estimators in the case of measurement error (as expected by theory in the case of no measurement error). R code enabling users to perform similar simulations is provided.},

	abstract = {Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner (ALS) data collected over 40 field sample plots with size 1000 m2 located in mature conifer forest. ALS data were collected with two different instruments, i.e., the ALTM 1233 and ALTM 3100 laser scanners (Optech Inc.). The ALTM 1233 data were acquired at a flying altitude of 1200 m and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 33 kHz. Three different acquisitions were carried out with ALTM 3100, i.e., (1) a flying altitude of 1100 m and a PRF of 50 kHz, (2) a flying altitude of 1100 m and a PRF of 100 kHz, and (3) a flying altitude of 2000 m and a PRF of 50 kHz. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were derived from the four different ALS datasets and for single+first and last echoes of the ALS data separately. The ALS-derived height- and density variables were assessed in pair-wise comparisons to evaluate the effects of (a) instrument, (b) flying altitude, and (c) PRF. A systematic shift in height values of up to 0.3 m between sensors when the first echoes were compared was demonstrated. Also the density-related variables differed significantly between the two instruments. Comparisons of flying altitudes and PRFs revealed upwards shifted canopy height distributions for the highest flying altitude (2000 m) and the lowest PRF (50 kHz). The distribution of echoes on different echo categories, i.e., single and multiple (first and last) echoes, differed significantly between acquisitions. The proportion of multiple echoes decreased with increasing flying altitude and PRF. Different echo categories have different properties since it is likely that single echoes tend to occur in the densest parts of the tree crowns, i.e., near the apex where the concentration of biological matter is highest and distance to the ground is largest. To assess the influence of instrument, flying altitude, and PRF on biophysical properties derived from ALS data, regression analysis was carried out to relate ALS-derived metrics to mean tree height (hL) and timber volume (V). Cross validation revealed only minor differences in precision for the different ALS acquisitions, but systematic differences between acquisitions of up to 2.5\% for hL and 10.7\% for V were found when comparing data from different acquisitions.},

The plot size was 300–400 m2 and the average stand size was 1.7 ha. Spruce and pine were the dominant tree species. Canopy height distributions were created from both first and last pulse data. The laser data were acquired from two different flying altitudes, i.e., 530–540 and 840–850 m above ground. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. Corresponding metrics derived from the two different flying altitudes were compared. Only 1 of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data differed significantly between flying altitudes. For the last pulse data, the mean values of the height percentiles were up to 50 cm higher than the corresponding values of the low-altitude data. The high-altitude data yielded significantly higher values for most of the canopy density measures. The standard deviation for the differences between high and low flying altitude for each of the metrics was estimated. The standard deviations for the height percentiles ranged from 0.07 to 0.30 cm in the forest stands, indicating a large degree of stability between repeated flight overpasses. The effect of variable flying altitude on mean tree height (hL), stand basal area (G), and stand volume (V) estimated from the laser-derived height and density measures using a two-stage inventory procedure was assessed by randomly combining laser data from the two flying altitudes for each individual sample plot and forest stand. The sample plots were used as training data to calibrate the models. The random assignment was repeated 10,000 times. The results of the 10,000 trials indicated that the precision of the estimated values of hL, G, and V was robust against alterations in flying altitude.},

	abstract = {Operational pulse density affects the measurements based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, especially at the individual tree level. The minimum density required depends on the interpretation methodology used, i.e., knowing the requirements is a prerequisite for a successful ALS data acquisition. We evaluate these requirements for a recently introduced alpha shape metrics approach in which computational volume and complexity metrics derived from ALS point clouds are utilized to produce actual tree-level characteristics. We simulated thinnings to the ALS return data using a test dataset of a total of 92 dominant or codominant trees detected and delineated manually from very high density (approximately 40 returns/m2) initial ALS data and produced species and diameter at breast height estimates with the thinned datasets. We compared the alpha shape metrics approach with alternative methods, making additional use of tree-level ALS data, and examined the sensitivity of the different methods to pulse density. The results show that in addition to the species classification possibilities recognized earlier, alpha shape metrics computed from very high density ALS data are also useful for predicting tree dimensions. Upon analysing the thinned data, the alpha shape metrics were generally discovered to suffer most from a lower pulse density. On the other hand, tree level canopy height distribution variables appeared to be more neutral for the pulse density and could be used at low density levels to complement and stabilize the alpha shape based methods for predicting both species and diameter. The results indicate that, provided individual trees can be accurately delineated, the species and diameter of mature coniferous trees in particular can be predicted using ALS data, even with a very low pulse density. As the alpha shape metrics performed well at densities that were only moderate for the individual tree delineation approach, more research is suggested to determine their full potential. Additionally, identifying trees automatically using more representative data needs to be examined to generalize the obtained result.},

	abstract = {The k-nearest neighbour estimation method is one of the main tools used in multi-source forest inventories. It is a powerful non-parametric method for which estimates are easy to compute and relatively accurate. One downside of this method is that it lacks an uncertainty measure for predicted values and for areas of an arbitrary size. We present a method to estimate the prediction uncertainty based on the variogram model which derives the necessary formula for the k-nn method. A data application is illustrated for multi-source forest inventory data, and the results are compared at pixel level to the conventional RMSE method. We find that the variogram model-based method which is analytic, is competitive with the RMSE method.},

	abstract = {Discrete airborne lidar is increasingly used to analyze forest structure. Technological improvements in lidar sensors have led to the acquisition of increasingly high pulse densities, possibly reflecting the assumption that higher densities will yield better results. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between pulse density and the ability to predict several commonly used forest measures and metrics at the plot scale. The accuracy of predicted metrics was largely invariant to changes in pulse density at moderate to high densities. In particular, correlations between metrics such as tree height, diameter at breast height, shrub height and total basal area were relatively unaffected until pulse densities dropped below 1pulse/m2. Metrics pertaining to coverage, such as canopy cover, tree density and shrub cover were more sensitive to changes in pulse density, although in some cases high prediction accuracy was still possible at lower densities. Our findings did not depend on the type of predictive algorithm used, although we found that support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian processes (GP) consistently outperformed multiple regression across a range of pulse densities. Further, we found that SVR yielded higher accuracies at low densities ({\textless}0.3pl/m2), while GP was better at high densities ({\textgreater}1pl/m2). Our results suggest that low-density lidar data may be capable of estimating typical forest structure metrics reliably in some situations. These results provide practical guidance to forest ecologists and land managers who are faced with tradeoff in price, quality and coverage, when planning new lidar data acquisition.},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has gained importance in the forest management and forest policy processes in recent years. Ensuring the sustainable provision of ecosystem services requires accurate information of the current provision and methods for predicting the impact of important drivers, such as changes in land cover and land use. In this review, we define the sources of uncertainties in forest-related ecosystem service assessments and discuss their importance to the usability of the information for different purposes. The uncertainties are due to e.g. variation in the selected indicators for the ecosystem services, lack of primary information on them, poor correlation with the data used for mapping the ecosystem services to larger scale and for predicting the impacts of human interventions. The uncertainties can be random or non-random and their assessment is often ignored, especially in the case of the non-random errors. As a result, different assessments and subsequent decision recommendations can be highly conflicting. We do not expect that the accuracies would significantly improve in the short term. The best way to proceed is therefore to assess the uncertainties and take them into account in the decision making for forest management.},

	abstract = {High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, “Random Forest” estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at {\textasciitilde}100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

The simultaneous nearest neighbor imputation for all tree species and separate imputation by tree species are evaluated with total volume calibration as a prediction method for diameter distributions. ContextThis study considers the predictions of species-specific diameter distributions in Finnish boreal forests by means of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and aerial images.AimsThe aim was to investigate different configurations in non-parametric nearest neighbor (NN) imputation and to determine how changes in configurations affect prediction error rates for timber assortment volumes and the error indices of the diameter distributions.MethodsNon-parametric NN imputation was used as a modeling method and was applied in two different ways: (1) diameter distributions were predicted at the same time for all tree species by simultaneous NN imputation, and (2) diameter distributions were predicted for one tree species at a time by separate NN imputation. Calibration to a regression-based total volume prediction was applied in both cases.ResultsThe results indicated that significant changes in the volume prediction error rates for timber assortment and for error indices can be achieved by the selection of responses, calibration to total volume, and separate NN imputation by tree species.ConclusionOverall, the selection of response variables in NN imputation and calibration to total volume improved the predicted diameter distribution error rates. The most successful prediction performance of diameter distribution was achieved by separate NN imputation by tree species.},

	abstract = {This study aims at the development of a model to predict forest stand variables in management units (stands) from sample plot inventory data. For this purpose we apply a non-parametric most similar neighbour (MSN) approach. The study area is the municipal forest of Waldkirch, 13 km north-east of Freiburg, Germany, which comprises 328 forest stands and 834 sample plots. Low-resolution laser scanning data, classification variables as well rough estimations from the forest management planning serve as auxiliary variables. In order to avoid common problems of k-NN-approaches caused by asymmetry at the boundaries of the regression spaces and distorted distributions, forest stands are tessellated into subunits with an area approximately equivalent to an inventory sample plot. For each subunit only the one nearest neighbour is consulted. Predictions for target variables in stands are obtained by averaging the predictions for all subunits. After formulating a random parameter model with variance components, we calibrate the prior predictions by means of sample plot data within the forest stands via BLUPs (best linear unbiased predictors). Based on bootstrap simulations, prediction errors for most management units finally prove to be smaller than the design-based sampling error of the mean. The calibration approach shows superiority compared with pure non-parametric MSN predictions.},

Modelling the link between a study variable Y and auxiliary variables X—in pursuit of an improved accuracy in estimators—is typically done at the level of a sampling unit. However, for various reasons, it may only be possible to formulate a linking model at the level of an area of interest (AOI). Area-level models and their potential have rarely been explored in forestry. This study demonstrates, with data (Y = stem volume per ha) from four actual inventories aided by aerial laser scanner data (3 cases) or photogrammetric point clouds (1 case), application of three distinct models representing the currency of area-level modelling. The studied AOIs varied in size from forest management units to forest districts, and municipalities. The variance explained by X declined sharply with the average size of an AOI. In comparison with a direct estimate mean of Y in an AOI, all three models achieved practically important reduction in the relative root-mean-squared error of an AOI mean. In terms of the reduction in mean-squared errors, a model with a spatial location effect was overall most attractive. We recommend the pursuit of a spatial model component in area-level modelling as promising within the context of a forest inventory.},

	abstract = {Geostatistical estimates of a soil property by kriging are equivalent to the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs). Universal kriging is BLUP with a fixed-effect model that is some linear function of spatial co-ordinates, or more generally a linear function of some other secondary predictor variable when it is called kriging with external drift. A problem in universal kriging is to find a spatial variance model for the random variation, since empirical variograms estimated from the data by method-of-moments will be affected by both the random variation and that variation represented by the fixed effects. The geostatistical model of spatial variation is a special case of the linear mixed model where our data are modelled as the additive combination of fixed effects (e.g. the unknown mean, coefficients of a trend model), random effects (the spatially dependent random variation in the geostatistical context) and independent random error (nugget variation in geostatistics). Statisticians use residual maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate variance parameters, i.e. to obtain the variogram in a geostatistical context. REML estimates are consistent (they converge in probability to the parameters that are estimated) with less bias than both maximum likelihood estimates and method-of-moment estimates obtained from residuals of a fitted trend. If the estimate of the random effects variance model is inserted into the BLUP we have the empirical BLUP or E-BLUP. Despite representing the state of the art for prediction from a linear mixed model in statistics, the REML–E-BLUP has not been widely used in soil science, and in most studies reported in the soils literature the variogram is estimated with methods that are seriously biased if the fixed-effect structure is more complex than just an unknown constant mean (ordinary kriging). In this paper we describe the REML–E-BLUP and illustrate the method with some data on soil water content that exhibit a pronounced spatial trend.},

	abstract = {A spatial estimation procedure based on ordinary kriging is described and evaluated which consists of using only sampling sites contained within a moving window centered at the estimate location for modeling the covariance structure and constructing the kriging equations. The moving window, by depending on local data only to estimate the spatial covariance structure and calculate the estimate, is less affected by spatial trend in the data than conventional kriging approaches and implicitly models covariance nonstationarity. The window's covariance structure is estimated by automatically fitting a spherical variogram model to the unbiased estimates of semi-variance calculated at several lags. The automatic fit uses nonlinear least squares regression constrained by the nugget parameter being nonnegative. This estimation method is compared to the more standard method of ordinary kriging over fixed subregions by using both procedures in the analysis of NADP/NTN sulfate deposition data in the conterminous U.S. For this analysis, we find that the moving window scheme provides local variogram models which are minimally affected by trend, and that also this use of an ensemble of variograms allows the accurate modeling of a spatially changing covariance structure. Accurate spatial covariance modeling is needed by acid deposition effects researchers because it is a prerequisite for the calculation of defensible deposition confidence intervals from the error (kriging) variance.},

	abstract = {The main aim of spatial sampling is to collect samples in 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional space. It is typically used to estimate the total or mean for a parameter in an area, to optimize parameter estimations for unsampled locations, or to predict the location of a movable object. Some objectives are for populations, representing the “here and now”, whereas other objectives concern superpopulations that generate the populations. Data to be collected are usually spatially autocorrelated and heterogeneous, whereas sampling is usually not repeatable. In various senses it is distinct from the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data from a population in conventional sampling. The uncertainty for spatial sample estimation propagates along a chain from spatial variation in the stochastic field to sample distribution and statistical tools used to obtain an estimate. This uncertainty is measured using either a design-based or model-based method. Both methods can be used in population and superpopulation studies. An unbiased estimate with the lowest variance is thus a common goal in spatial sampling and inference.

For populations with spatial trends in the variables of interest, the estimation can be much improved by selecting samples that are well spread over the population. The method can be used for any number of dimensions and can hence also select spatially balanced samples in a space spanned by several auxiliary variables. Analysis and examples indicate that the suggested method achieves a high degree of spatial balance and is therefore efficient for populations with trends.},

Examples are forest management inventories, where a linking model is used in combination with airborne laser scanning data to estimate stand-level forest parameters where no or too few observations are collected within the stand. This paper focuses on different approaches to estimating the variances of those estimates. We compared a variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters with variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values. One of the latter variance estimators considered the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals whereas the other one did not. The estimators were applied using timber volume on stand level as the variable of interest and photogrammetric image matching data as auxiliary information. Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were used for model calibration and independent data clustered within stands were used for validation. The empirical coverage proportion (ECP) of confidence intervals (CIs) of the variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values was considerably higher than the ECP of the CI of the variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters. The ECP further increased when considering the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. The study also explores the link between confidence intervals that are based on variance estimates as well as the well-known confidence and prediction intervals of regression models.},

However, in cases where the simulation output variances are non-zero and not constant, many of the current metamodels which assume homogeneity, fail to provide satisfactory estimation. In this paper, we present a kriging model with modified nugget-effect adapted for simulations with heterogeneous variances. The new model improves the estimations of the sensitivity parameters by explicitly accounting for location dependent non-constant variances and smoothes the kriging predictor’s output accordingly. We look into the effects of stochastic noise on the parameter estimation for the classic kriging model that assumes deterministic outputs and note that the stochastic noise increases the variability of the classic parameter estimation. The nugget-effect and proposed modified nugget-effect stabilize the estimated parameters and decrease the erratic behavior of the predictor by penalizing the likelihood function affected by stochastic noise. Several numerical examples suggest that the kriging model with modified nugget-effect outperforms the kriging model with nugget-effect and the classic kriging model in heteroscedastic cases.},

To this end, biomass equations will remain a key component of future carbon measurements and estimation. As researchers in biomass and carbon estimation, we review the present scenario of aboveground biomass estimation, focusing particularly on estimation using tree-level models and identify some cautionary points that we believe will improve the accuracy of biomass and carbon estimates to meet societal needs. In addition, we discuss the critical challenges in developing or calibrating tree biomass models and opportunities for improved biomass. Some of the opportunities to improve biomass estimate include integration of taper and other attributes and combining different data sources. Biomass estimation is a complex process, when possible, we should make use of already available resources such as wood density and forest inventory databases. Combining different data-sets for model development and using independent data-sets for model verification will offer opportunities to improve biomass estimation. Focus should also be made on belowground biomass estimation to accurately estimate the full forest contribution to carbon sequestration. In addition, we suggest developing comprehensive biomass estimation methods that account for differences in site and stand density and improve forest biomass modeling and validation at a range of spatial scales.},

The method uses spatial data that is generated with a harvester to simulate individual tree locations. The simulation uses two probability density functions: the distance and the angle from the harvester at which the tree is cut. The average estimated volume root mean squared error varied from 4\% for 0.4 ha subregions to 29\% for 0.03 ha subregions. The stand subdivision method affected the accuracy of volume estimation only in the smallest subregions. Compared with the use of harvester data as such, i.e. without tree location simulation, the improvement in total and species-wise volume estimates varied between 5 and 35\%. The data produced by the method can be used as a field data source for remote sensing methods as well as a verification data set for field inventories. However, a question remains over the generality of the model parameters used.},

	abstract = {Several methods are used to correct total soil carbon data in response to land use or management changes inherently coupled with concomitant alteration to bulk density (BD). However, a rigorous evaluation of correction methods has not been conducted. We compared original, maximum, and minimum equivalent soil mass (ESM) corrections to the fixed depth (FD) method and direct C concentrations. In a simulation exercise of a tillage event that decreased BD without change in total C concentration to a depth of 0.3m, the original and maximum ESM methods estimated changes in total C storage of −0.34 to 0.54MgCha−1, well within the range of field soil C variability. In contrast, the minimum ESM method estimated changes ranging from −1.19 to 1.01MgCha−1. In a field experiment on reduced and intensive tillage, soil C changes (0–0.18m) were measured from May to August 2006. The maximum ESM method generally overestimated soil C changes by −0.16 to 0.60MgCha−1 and the minimum ESM method underestimated them by −2.67 to 0.23MgCha−1 compared to the original ESM method. Field-scale soil C changes (0–0.15m) were also measured from August 2003 to June 2005 and decreased by an unrealistic 6.64MgCha−1 over the first 6 months after tillage when the FD method was used. In contrast, the effect of tillage on soil C could be reasonably estimated by directly comparing changes in C concentration. In a compacted agricultural soil, we found more errors in simulated C differences when using the maximum than the minimum ESM method. Regardless of the direction of BD changes, the minimum ESM method was a better choice than the maximum ESM method in native and restored grassland systems where soil C concentrations decreased through the soil profile. We conclude that (1) the FD method is often not suitable and might be less accurate than direct C concentration measurements, and (2) the maximum/minimum ESM method can be accurate depending on the conditions (e.g., increasing or decreasing BD, systems conversion type), but (3) that the original ESM method is optimal for detecting soil C changes due to land use changes or management effects.},

We developed systems of weighted nonlinear allometric equations to estimate total, above- and below-ground biomass for Dipterocarp forests (DF) and Evergreen broadleaf forests (EBLF) in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam, as well as for a dominant plant family (Dipterocarpaceae; Dip) in the DF. A total of 175 trees were destructively sampled for both AGB and BGB, with whole root extraction as the method of BGB sampling. Different equation forms for AGB and BGB incorporating diameter at breast height (D), tree height (H), wood density (WD) and crown area (CA) were evaluated. The best system of equations for the DF, Dipterocarpaceae in the DF, and EBLF was selected based on validation statistics of percent bias (PBias), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared percent error (RMSPE). All three systems of equations developed in this study used D2×H×WD as a predictor for AGB and a simpler BGB equation form with either D2×H or D as the sole predictor variable. The addition of WD or CA to BGB equation forms did not substantially improve validation statistics over simpler forms. These allometric equations should contribute to advancing our understanding of carbon distribution of trees in these tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Land-use change (LUC) is a major driving factor for the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the global carbon cycle. The temporal dynamic of SOC after LUC is especially important in temperate systems with a long reaction time. On the basis of 95 compiled studies covering 322 sites in the temperate zone, carbon response functions (CRFs) were derived to model the temporal dynamic of SOC after five different LUC types (mean soil depth of 30±6 cm). Grassland establishment caused a long lasting carbon sink with a relative stock change of 128±23\% and afforestation on former cropland a sink of 116±54\%, 100 years after LUC (mean±95\% confidence interval). No new equilibrium was reached within 120 years. In contrast, there was no SOC sink following afforestation of grasslands and 75\% of all observations showed SOC losses, even after 100 years. Only in the forest floor, there was carbon accumulation of 0.38±0.04 Mg ha−1 yr−1 in afforestations adding up to 38±4 Mg ha−1 labile carbon after 100 years. Carbon loss after deforestation (−32±20\%) and grassland conversion to cropland (−36±5\%), was rapid with a new SOC equilibrium being reached after 23 and 17 years, respectively. The change rate of SOC increased with temperature and precipitation but decreased with soil depth and clay content. Subsoil SOC changes followed the trend of the topsoil SOC changes but were smaller (25±5\% of the total SOC changes) and with a high uncertainty due to a limited number of datasets. As a simple and robust model approach, the developed CRFs provide an easily applicable tool to estimate SOC stock changes after LUC to improve greenhouse gas reporting in the framework of UNFCCC.},

	abstract = {The dry dipterocarp forest (DDF) is a major and unique forest type in Asia providing both protection and production functions. DDF's role as a carbon sink is important in Asia, but there is a deficiency in existing biomass models for these forests. This study aimed to develop simultaneous modeling systems to estimate tree above-ground biomass (AGB) and its components for mixed species, dominant family, genera, and species. Twenty-eight 0.25 ha plots in the Central highlands and one 1 ha plot in the Southeast ecoregion in Viet Nam were measured. A total of 329 trees were destructively sampled to obtain a dataset of the dry biomass of the stem (Bst), branches (Bbr), leaves (Ble), bark (Bba), and AGB. Using K-fold cross validation, we compared AGB predictions from independently developed AGB equation and from a system of biomass equations that estimated component biomass and AGB simultaneously. The estimation methods for independent equation was weighted nonlinear regression fit by maximum likelihood and for simultaneous system it was weighted nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) fit by generalized least squares. We also examined different modeling systems for different plant classification at taxonomic levels. The selected form of taxon-specific modeling systems were AGB = a1 × Db11 × Hb12 × WDb13 + a2 × Db21 + a3 × Db31 + a4 × Db41 for mixed species and dominant Dipterocarpaceae family and AGB = a1 × Db11 + a2 × Db21 + a3 × Db31 + a4 × Db41 for dominant genera of Dipterocarpus and Shorea. The predictors of D, H, and WD are diameter at breast height, tree height and wood density, respectively. Compared to the mixed species modeling system, genus-specific modeling systems improved the reliability of AGB estimation substantially and will reduce the cost of application because the only predictor required for measurement is D. The pantropical genus-specific modeling systems are more reliable than pantropical mixed species models.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are a function of the SOC concentration and the bulk density of the fine soil. Both variables are prone to changes and are influenced by abiotic and biotic processes. To determine the effect of variations of both variables on SOC stocks at two grassland sites, one with Stagnic Vertisols and one with Orthoeutric Arenosols, 440 soil cores were sampled down to 60cm depth. Bulk density and C and N concentrations were measured in 5cm intervals (0–10cm depth) and 10cm intervals (10–60cm depth). SOC stocks at the clay rich site with Vertisols were almost twice as high (86t C ha−1 in 0–60cm depth) as at the sandy site with Arenosols (48t C ha−1). Variations in the SOC stocks were determined by the thickness of the loess layer at the clay rich site. Underlying clay horizons hampered the C translocation into the subsoil which resulted in lower SOC stocks of the whole profile. Semivariograms showed spatial autocorrelations of SOC concentrations within a range of 47 and 131m, respectively. The range of autocorrelation between samples of bulk density was much shorter (39 and 51m). Relative variances in bulk density were 1–2 magnitudes lower than the variability of SOC concentration and decreased rapidly as soil depth increased. The difference in the variation of SOC concentration and bulk density was used to revise the sampling design for SOC stocks. An unequal number of samples, i.e. more SOC concentration samples than bulk density samples, would not necessarily decrease the power of the sampling design to detect SOC stock changes. In contrast, the optimum sampling design for these sites would consist of 33–44\% bulk density samples and 56–67\% SOC concentration samples.},

While these factors are reasonably well documented in countries of the northern mid-latitudes as a result of systematic forest inventories, they are uncertain in the tropics. Recent estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation have focused on the uncertainty in rates of deforestation. By using the same data for biomass, however, these studies have underestimated the total uncertainty of tropical emissions and may have biased the estimates. In particular, regional and country-specific estimates of forest biomass reported by three successive assessments of tropical forest resources by the FAO indicate systematic changes in biomass that have not been taken into account in recent estimates of tropical carbon emissions. The ‘changes’ more likely represent improved information than real on-the-ground changes in carbon storage. In either case, however, the data have a significant effect on current estimates of carbon emissions from the tropics and, hence, on understanding the global carbon balance.},

	abstract = {Amstat News asked three review editors to rate their top five favorite books in the September 2003 issue. Methods of Multivariate Analysis was among those chosen. When measuring several variables on a complex experimental unit, it is often necessary to analyze the variables simultaneously, rather than isolate them and consider them individually. Multivariate analysis enables researchers to explore the joint performance of such variables and to determine the effect of each variable in the presence of the others. The Second Edition of Alvin Rencher's Methods of Multivariate Analysis provides students of all statistical backgrounds with both the fundamental and more sophisticated skills necessary to master the discipline. To illustrate multivariate applications, the author provides examples and exercises based on fifty-nine real data sets from a wide variety of scientific fields. Rencher takes a "methods" approach to his subject, with an emphasis on how students and practitioners can employ multivariate analysis in real-life situations. The Second Edition contains revised and updated chapters from the critically acclaimed First Edition as well as brand-new chapters on:   Cluster analysis   Multidimensional scaling   Correspondence analysis   Biplots   Each chapter contains exercises, with corresponding answers and hints in the appendix, providing students the opportunity to test and extend their understanding of the subject. Methods of Multivariate Analysis provides an authoritative reference for statistics students as well as for practicing scientists and clinicians.},

	abstract = {Models are not perfect; they do not fit the data exactly and they do not allow exact prediction. Given that models are imperfect, we need to assess the uncertainties in the fits of the models and their ability to predict new outcomes. The goals of building models for scientific problems include (1) understanding and developing appropriate relationships between variables, and (2) predicting variables in the future or at locations where data have not been collected. Ecological models range in complexity from those that are relatively simple (e.g., linear regression) to those that are very complex (e.g., ecosystem models, forest-growth models, and nitrogen-cycling models). In a mathematical model, parameters control the relationships between variables in the model. In this framework of parametric modeling, inference is the process whereby we take output (data) and estimate model parameters, whereas deduction is the process whereby we take a parameterized model and obtain output (data) or deduce properties. We often add random components in both inference and deduction to reflect a model’s lack-of-fit and our uncertainty about predicting outcomes. Complex models in ecology have largely been of the deductive type, where the scientist takes some values of parameters (usually obtained from an independent data source or chosen from a reasonable range of values) and then simulates results based on model relationships. These models may be quite realistic, but the manner in which their parameters are obtained for the simulations is questionable.},

	abstract = {The problem of simultaneous covariate selection and parameter inference for spatial regression models is considered. Previous research has shown that failure to take spatial correlation into account can influence the outcome of standard model selection methods. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is investigated for the calculation of parameter estimates and posterior model probabilities for spatial regression models. The method can accommodate normal and non-normal response data and a large number of covariates. Thus the method is very flexible and can be used to fit spatial linear models, spatial linear mixed models, and spatial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). The Bayesian MCMC method also allows a priori unequal weighting of covariates, which is not possible with many model selection methods such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The proposed method is demonstrated on two data sets. The first is the whiptail lizard data set which has been previously analyzed by other researchers investigating model selection methods. Our results confirmed the previous analysis suggesting that sandy soil and ant abundance were strongly associated with lizard abundance. The second data set concerned pollution tolerant fish abundance in relation to several environmental factors. Results indicate that abundance is positively related to Strahler stream order and a habitat quality index. Abundance is negatively related to percent watershed disturbance.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of carbon fluxes and states at regional scales are 
required to reduce uncertainties in regional carbon balance estimates
and to support decision making in environmental politics. In this work
the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5-BGC) was applied at a high
spatial resolution (1 km2) for the Rur catchment in western Germany. In
order to improve the model-data consistency of net ecosystem exchange
(NEE) and leaf area index (LAI) for this study area, five plant
functional type (PFT)-specific CLM4.5-BGC parameters were estimated with
time series of half-hourly NEE data for one year in 2011/2012, using the
DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm, a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The parameters were estimated
separately for four different plant functional types (needleleaf
evergreen temperate tree, broadleaf deciduous temperate tree, C3-grass
and C3-crop) at four different sites. The four sites are located inside
or close to the Rur catchment. We evaluated modeled NEE for one year in
2012/2013 with NEE measured at seven eddy covariance sites in the
catchment, including the four parameter estimation sites. Modeled LAI
was evaluated by means of LAI derived from remotely sensed RapidEye
images of about 18 days in 2011/2012. Performance indices were based on
a comparison between measurements and (i) a reference run with CLM
default parameters, and (ii) a 60 instance CLM ensemble with parameters
sampled from the DREAM posterior probability density functions (pdfs).
The difference between the observed and simulated NEE sum reduced 23\% if
estimated parameters instead of default parameters were used as input.
The mean absolute difference between modeled and measured LAI was
reduced by 59\% on average. Simulated LAI was not only improved in terms
of the absolute value but in some cases also in terms of the timing
(beginning of vegetation onset), which was directly related to a
substantial improvement of the NEE estimates in spring. In order to
obtain a more comprehensive estimate of the model uncertainty, a second
CLM ensemble was set up, where initial conditions and atmospheric
forcings were perturbed in addition to the parameter estimates. This
resulted in very high standard deviations (STD) of the modeled annual
NEE sums for C3-grass and C3-crop PFTs, ranging between 24.1 and 225.9
gC m-2 y-1, compared to STD = 0.1 - 3.4 gC m-2 y-1 (effect of parameter
uncertainty only, without additional perturbation of initial states and
atmospheric forcings). The higher spread of modeled NEE for the C3-crop
and C3-grass indicated that the model uncertainty was notably higher for
those PFTs compared to the forest-PFTs. Our findings highlight the
potential of parameter and uncertainty estimation to support the
understanding and further development of land surface models such as
CLM.},

	abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests (‘mixed forests’). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems.},

The WUI is thus a focal area for human– environment conflicts, such as the destruction of homes by wildfires, habitat fragmentation, introduction of exotic species, and biodiversity decline. Our goal was to conduct a spatially detailed assessment of the WUI across the United States to provide a framework for scientific inquiries into housing growth effects on the environment and to inform both national policymakers and local land managers about the WUI and associated issues. The WUI in the conterminous United States covers 719 156 km2 (9\% of land area) and contains 44.8 million housing units (39\% of all houses). WUI areas are particularly widespread in the eastern United States, reaching a maximum of 72\% of land area in Connecticut. California has the highest number of WUI housing units (5.1 million). The extent of the WUI highlights the need for ecological principles in land-use planning as well as sprawl-limiting policies to adequately address both wildfire threats and conservation problems.},

	abstract = {The Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NNFI) provides estimates of forest parameters on national and regional scales by means of a systematic network of permanent sample plots. One of the biggest challenges for the NNFI is the interest in forest attribute information for small sub-populations such as municipalities or protected areas. Frequently, too few sampled observations are available for such small areas to allow estimates with acceptable precision. However, if an auxiliary variable exists that is correlated with the variable of interest, small area estimation (SAE) techniques may provide means to improve the precision of estimates. The study aimed at estimating the mean above-ground forest biomass for small areas with high precision and accuracy, using SAE techniques. For this purpose, the simple random sampling (SRS) estimator, the generalized regression (GREG) estimator, and the unit-level empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator were compared. Mean canopy height obtained from a photogrammetric canopy height model (CHM) was the auxiliary variable available for every population element. The small areas were 14 municipalities within a 2,184 km2 study area for which an estimate of the mean forest biomass was sought. The municipalities were between 31 and 527 km2 and contained 1–35 NNFI sample plots located within forest. The mean canopy height obtained from the CHM was found to have a strong linear correlation with forest biomass. Both the SRS estimator and the GREG estimator result in unstable estimates if they are based on too few observations. Although this is not the case for the EBLUP estimator, the estimators were only compared for municipalities with more than five sample plots. The SRS resulted in the highest standard errors in all municipalities. Whereas the GREG and EBLUP standard errors were similar for small areas with many sample plots, the EBLUP standard error was usually smaller than the GREG standard error. The difference between the EBLUP and GREG standard error increased with a decreasing number of sample plots within the small area.

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of live and dead biomass in forested ecosystems is important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity, wildfire behavior, and for forest management. Lidar remote sensing has been used successfully to estimate live biomass, but studies focusing on dead biomass are rare. We used lidar data, in conjunction with field measurements from 58 plots to distinguish between and map standing live and dead tree biomass in the mixed coniferous forest of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA. Lidar intensity and canopy volume were key variables for estimating live biomass, whereas for dead biomass, lidar intensity alone was critical for accurate estimation. Regression estimates of both live and dead biomass ranged between 0 and 600 Mg ha−1, with means of 195.08 Mg ha−1 and 65.73 Mg ha−1, respectively. Cross validation with field data resulted in correlation coefficients for predicted vs. observed of 0.85 for live biomass (RMSE=50 Mg ha−1 and \%RMSE (RMSE as a percent of the mean)=26). For dead biomass, correlation was 0.79, RMSE was 42 Mg ha−1, and \%RMSE was 63. Biomass maps revealed interesting patterns of live and dead standing tree biomass. Live biomass was highest in the ponderosa pine zone, and decreased from south to north through the mixed conifer and spruce–fir forest zones. Dead biomass exhibited a background range of values in these mature forests from zero to 100 Mg ha−1, with lower values in locations having higher live biomass. In areas with high dead biomass values, live biomass was near zero. These areas were associated with recent wildfires, as indicated by fire maps derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Project (MTBS). Combining our dead biomass maps with the MTBS maps, we demonstrated the complementary power of these two datasets, revealing that MTBS burn intensity class can be described quantitatively in terms of dead biomass. Assuming a background range of dead biomass up to 100 Mg ha−1, it is possible to estimate and map the contribution to the standing dead tree biomass pool associated with recent wildfire.},

	abstract = {Errors in individual tree detection and delineation affect diameter distribution predictions based on crown attributes extracted from the detected trees. We develop a methodology for circumventing these problems. The method is based on matching cumulative distribution functions of field measured tree diameter distributions and crown radii distributions extracted from airborne laser scanning data through individual tree detection presented by Vauhkonen and Mehtätalo (2015). In this study, empirical distribution functions and a monotonic, nonlinear model curve are introduced. Tree crown radius distribution produced by individual tree detection is corrected by a method taking into account that all trees cannot be detected. The evaluation is based on the ability of the developed model sequence to predict quadratic mean diameter and total basal area. The studied data consists of 36 field plots in a typical boreal managed forest area in eastern Finland. The suggested enhancements to the model sequence produce improved results in most of the test cases. Most notably, in leave-one-out cross-validation experiments the modified models improve RMSE of basal area 13\% in the full data and RMSE of quadratic mean diameter and basal area 69\% and 11\%, respectively, in pure pine plots. Better modeling of the crown radius distribution and improved matching between crown radii and stem diameters add the operational premises of the full distribution matching.},

A hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimation is adopted. Posterior distributions are approximated by means of MCMC computation methods.

	abstract = {Airborne LiDAR is increasingly used in forest carbon, ecosystem, and resource monitoring. For practical design and manufacture reasons, the 1064 nm near-infrared (NIR) wavelength has been the most commonly adopted, and most literature in this field represents sampling characteristics in this wavelength. However, due to eye-safety and application-specific needs, other common wavelengths are 1550 nm and 532 nm. All provide canopy structure reconstructions that can be integrated or compared through space and time but the consistency or complementarity of 3D airborne LiDAR data sampled at multiple wavelengths is poorly understood. Here, we report on multispectral LiDAR missions carried out in 2013 and 2015 over a managed forest research site. The 1st used 3 independent sensors, and the 2nd used a single sensor carrying 3 lasers. The experiment revealed differences in proportions of returns at ground level, vertical foliage distributions, and gap probability across wavelengths. Canopy attenuation was greatest at 532 nm, presumably due to leaf tissue absorption. Relative to 1064 nm, foliage was undersampled at midheight percentiles at 1550 nm and 532 nm. Multisensor data demonstrated differences in foliage characterization due to combined influences of wavelength and acquisition configuration. Single-sensor multispectral data were more stable but demonstrated clear wavelength-dependent variation that could be exploited in intensity-based land cover classification without the aid of 3D derivatives. This work sets the stage for improvements in land surface classification and vertical foliage partitioning through the integration of active spectral and structural laser return information.},

	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data have been increasingly used for forest classification due to its ability to penetrate the forest canopy and provide detail about the structure of the lower strata. In this study we demonstrate forest classification approaches using airborne lidar data as inputs to random forest and linear unmixing classification algorithms. Our results demonstrated that both random forest and linear unmixing models identified a distribution of rainforest and eucalypt stands that was comparable to existing ecological vegetation class (EVC) maps based primarily on manual interpretation of high resolution aerial imagery. Rainforest stands were also identified in the region that have not previously been identified in the EVC maps. The transition between stand types was better characterised by the random forest modelling approach. In contrast, the linear unmixing model placed greater emphasis on field plots selected as endmembers which may not have captured the variability in stand structure within a single stand type. The random forest model had the highest overall accuracy (84\%) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (0.62). However, the classification accuracy was only marginally better than linear unmixing. The random forest model was applied to a region in the Central Highlands of south-eastern Australia to produce maps of stand type probability, including areas of transition (the ‘ecotone’) between rainforest and eucalypt forest. The resulting map provided a detailed delineation of forest classes, which specifically recognised the coalescing of stand types at the landscape scale. This represents a key step towards mapping the structural and spatial complexity of these ecosystems, which is important for both their management and conservation.},

In the 1980s, mappers transitioned from aerial photography to digital remote sensing, in particular Landsat satellite imagery, which still plays a significant role in forest mapping, but today mappers increasingly rely on Lidar analysis. In California, where forests are complex and difficult to accurately map, numerous remote sensing scientists have pioneered development of methodologies for forest mapping with Lidar. Lidar has been used successfully here in a number of ways: to capture forest structure, to map individual trees in forests and critical wildlife habitat characteristics, to predict forest volume and biomass, to develop inputs for forest fire behavior modeling, and to map forest topography and infrastructure. Lidar can be costly to acquire and difficult to analyze, but as costs decline and new data processing methods are developed, it is likely that forest managers who need detailed information on forest structure across large spatial scales will incorporate Lidar data into their mapping toolkits.},

	abstract = {Accurate and precise location of trees from data acquired under-the-canopy is challenging and time-consuming. However, current forestry practices would benefit tremendously from the knowledge of tree coordinates, particularly when the information used to position them is acquired with inexpensive sensors. Therefore, the objective of our study is to geo-reference trees using point clouds created from the images acquired below canopy. We developed a procedure that uses the coordinates of the trees seen from above canopy to position the same trees seen below canopy. To geo-reference the trees from above canopy we captured images with an unmanned aerial vehicle. We reconstructed the trunk with photogrammetric point clouds built with a structure\&ndash;from\&ndash;motion procedure from images recorded in a circular pattern at multiple locations throughout the stand. We matched the trees segmented from below canopy with the trees extracted from above canopy using a non-rigid point-matching algorithm. To ensure accuracy, we reduced the number of matching trees by dividing the trees segmented from above using a grid with 50 m cells. Our procedure was implemented on a 7.1 ha Douglas-fir stand from Oregon USA. The proposed procedure is relatively fast, as approximately 600 trees were mapped in approximately 1 min. The procedure is sensitive to the point density, directly impacting tree location, as differences larger than 2 m between the coordinates of the tree top and the bottom part of the stem could lead to matching errors larger than 1 m. Furthermore, the larger the number of trees to be matched the higher the accuracy is, which could allow for misalignment errors larger than 2 m between the locations of the trees segmented from above and below.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of airborne lidar technology to measure forest biophysical characteristics has been rapidly increasing. This paper discusses processing algorithms for deriving the terrain model and estimating tree heights by using a multiple return, high–density, small-footprint lidar data set. The lidar data were acquired over deciduous, coniferous, and mixed stands of varying age classes and settings typical of the southeastern US. The specific objectives were: (1) to develop and test algorithms to estimate plot level tree height using lidar data, and (2) to investigate how ground measurements can help in the processing phase of lidar data for tree height assessment. The study area is located in the Piedmont physiographic province of Virginia, USA and includes a portion of the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest (37°25′N, 78°41′W). Two lidar processing algorithms are discussed—the first based on single tree crown identification using a variable window size for local filtering, and the second based on the height of all laser pulses within the area covered by the ground truth data. Height estimates resulted from processing lidar data with both algorithms were compared to field measurements obtained with a plot design following the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data layout. Linear regression was used to develop equations relating lidar-estimated parameters with field inventories for each of the FIA plots. As expected, the maximum height on each plot was predicted with the highest accuracy (R2 values of 85 and 90\%, for the first and the second algorithm, respectively). The variable window size algorithm performed better for predicting heights of dominant and co-dominant trees (R2 values 84–85\%), with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 12.7 cm (5 in), when compared with the algorithm based on all laser heights (R2 values 57–73\%). The use of field-based height thresholds when processing lidar data did not bring significant gains in explaining the total variation associated with tree height. The technique of local filtering with a variable window size considers fundamental forest biometrics relationships and overall proved to give better results than the technique of all laser shots.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel, region-growing algorithm for the fast surface patch segmentation of three-dimensional point clouds of urban environments. The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages based on a coarse-to-fine concept. First, a region-growing step is performed on an octree-based voxelized representation of the input point cloud to extract major (coarse) segments. The output is then passed through a refinement process. As part of this, there are two competing factors related to voxel size selection. To balance the constraints, an adaptive octree is created in two stages. Empirical studies on real terrestrial and airborne laser scanning data for complex buildings and an urban setting show the proposed approach to be at least an order of magnitude faster when compared to a conventional region growing method and able to incorporate semantic-based feature criteria, while achieving precision, recall, and fitness scores of at least 75\% and as much as 95\%.},

	abstract = {Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land-cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6\% of studies involve an area less than 300ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised object-based image classification.},

Computerized segmentation of a diverse range of remote sensing material has been studied for delineating stands in various forest types, but is relatively rare under tropical conditions. In line with REDD+, which advocates sustainable forest management in tropical developing countries, we report here on the delineation of forest stands in Laos using data from Airborne Laser Scanning, Airborne CIR and ALOS AVNIR-2. Rather than using the spectral layers alone, the segmentation was applied to wall-to-wall maps of predicted values from empirical models that retrieve forest stem volume and basal area. The homogeneity of 96 sets of segmentation categorized according to the hierarchical mean sizes of the segments was evaluated quantitatively in terms of the AICvar index and qualitatively by eye. The results show that the quality and performance of the empirical models are duly reflected in the quality and performance of the segmentation, and that the most competitive delineations are provided by models that involve ALS. Finally, the future prospects for using this empirical model-based segmentation approach to detect and quantify deforestation, or even forest degradation, and thereby to provide further support for the development of REDD methodology, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Image segmentation is an important processing step in many image, video and computer vision applications. Extensive research has been done in creating many different approaches and algorithms for image segmentation, but it is still difficult to assess whether one algorithm produces more accurate segmentations than another, whether it be for a particular image or set of images, or more generally, for a whole class of images. To date, the most common method for evaluating the effectiveness of a segmentation method is subjective evaluation, in which a human visually compares the image segmentation results for separate segmentation algorithms, which is a tedious process and inherently limits the depth of evaluation to a relatively small number of segmentation comparisons over a predetermined set of images. Another common evaluation alternative is supervised evaluation, in which a segmented image is compared against a manually-segmented or pre-processed reference image. Evaluation methods that require user assistance, such as subjective evaluation and supervised evaluation, are infeasible in many vision applications, so unsupervised methods are necessary. Unsupervised evaluation enables the objective comparison of both different segmentation methods and different parameterizations of a single method, without requiring human visual comparisons or comparison with a manually-segmented or pre-processed reference image. Additionally, unsupervised methods generate results for individual images and images whose characteristics may not be known until evaluation time. Unsupervised methods are crucial to real-time segmentation evaluation, and can furthermore enable self-tuning of algorithm parameters based on evaluation results. In this paper, we examine the unsupervised objective evaluation methods that have been proposed in the literature. An extensive evaluation of these methods are presented. The advantages and shortcomings of the underlying design mechanisms in these methods are discussed and analyzed through analytical evaluation and empirical evaluation. Finally, possible future directions for research in unsupervised evaluation are proposed.},

	abstract = {Measuring individual trees can provide valuable information about forests, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been used recently to identify individual trees and measure structural tree parameters. Past results, however, have been mixed because of reliance on interpolated (image) versions of the LiDAR measurements and search methods that do not adapt to variations in canopies. In this work, an adaptive clustering method is developed using airborne LiDAR data acquired over two distinctly different managed pine forests in North-Central Florida, USA. A crucial issue in isolating individual trees is determining the appropriate size of the moving window (search radius) when locating seed points. The proposed approach works directly on the three-dimensional (3D) ‘cloud’ of LiDAR points and adapts to irregular canopies sizes. The region growing step yields collectively exhaustive sets in an initial segmentation of tree canopies. An agglomerative clustering step is then used to merge clusters that represent parts of whole canopies using locally varying height distribution. The overall tree detection accuracy achieved is 95.1\% with no significant bias. The tree detection enables subsequent estimation of tree height and vertical crown length to an accuracy better than 0.8 and 1.5 m, respectively.},

	abstract = {Variance estimation under systematic sampling with probability proportional to size is known to be a difficult problem. We attempt to tackle this problem by the bootstrap resampling method. It is shown that the usual way to bootstrap fails to give satisfactory variance estimates. As a remedy, we propose a double bootstrap method which is based on certain working models and involves two levels of resampling. Unlike existing methods which deal exclusively with the Horvitz–Thompson estimator, the double bootstrap method can be used to estimate the variance of any statistic. We illustrate this within the context of both mean and median estimation. Empirical results based on five natural populations are encouraging.},

	abstract = {Due to the availability of good and reasonably priced auxiliary data, the use of model-based regression-synthetic estimators for small area estimation is popular in operational settings. Examples are forest management inventories, where a linking model is used in combination with airborne laser scanning data to estimate stand-level forest parameters where no or too few observations are collected within the stand. This paper focuses on different approaches to estimating the variances of those estimates. We compared a variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters with variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values. One of the latter variance estimators considered the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals whereas the other one did not. The estimators were applied using timber volume on stand level as the variable of interest and photogrammetric image matching data as auxiliary information. Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were used for model calibration and independent data clustered within stands were used for validation. The empirical coverage proportion (ECP) of confidence intervals (CIs) of the variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values was considerably higher than the ECP of the CI of the variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters. The ECP further increased when considering the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. The study also explores the link between confidence intervals that are based on variance estimates as well as the well-known confidence and prediction intervals of regression models.},

	abstract = {The spatial shape of a precipitation event has an important role in determining the catchment's hydrological response to a storm. To be able to generate stochastic design storms with a realistic spatial structure, the anisotropy of the storm has to be quantified. In this paper, a method is proposed to estimate the anisotropy of precipitation fields, using the concept of linear Generalized Scale Invariance (GSI). The proposed method is based on identifying the values of GSI parameters that best describe isolines of constant power on the two-dimensional power spectrum of the fields. The method is evaluated using two sets of simulated fields with known anisotropy and a measured precipitation event with an unknown anisotropy from Brisbane, Australia. It is capable of accurately estimating the anisotropy parameters of simulated nonzero fields, whereas introducing the rain-no rain intermittency alters the power spectra of the fields and slightly reduces the accuracy of the parameter estimates. The parameters estimated for the measured event correspond well with the visual observations on the spatial structure of the fields. The method requires minimum amount of decision making and user interaction, making it suitable for analyzing anisotropy of storm events consisting of long time series of fields with a changing spatial structure.},

	abstract = {This study aims at the development of a model to predict forest stand variables in management units (stands) from sample plot inventory data. For this purpose we apply a non-parametric most similar neighbour (MSN) approach. The study area is the municipal forest of Waldkirch, 13 km north-east of Freiburg, Germany, which comprises 328 forest stands and 834 sample plots. Low-resolution laser scanning data, classification variables as well rough estimations from the forest management planning serve as auxiliary variables. In order to avoid common problems of k-NN-approaches caused by asymmetry at the boundaries of the regression spaces and distorted distributions, forest stands are tessellated into subunits with an area approximately equivalent to an inventory sample plot. For each subunit only the one nearest neighbour is consulted. Predictions for target variables in stands are obtained by averaging the predictions for all subunits. After formulating a random parameter model with variance components, we calibrate the prior predictions by means of sample plot data within the forest stands via BLUPs (best linear unbiased predictors). Based on bootstrap simulations, prediction errors for most management units finally prove to be smaller than the design-based sampling error of the mean. The calibration approach shows superiority compared with pure non-parametric MSN predictions.},

While earlier books concerning forest planning have tended to focus on linear programming, economic aspects, or specific multi-criteria decision aid tools, this book provides a much broader range of tools to meet a variety of planning situations. The methods themselves cover a range of decision situations – from cases involving single decision makers, through group decision making, to participatory planning. They include traditional decision support tools, from optimization to utility functions, as well as methods that are just gaining ground in forest planning – such as problem structuring methods and social choice theory. Including examples which illustrate the application of each technique to specific management planning problems, the book offers an invaluable resource for both researchers and advanced students specializing in management and planning issues relating to forestry.},

	abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) acquisitions are frequently carried out in long (several kilometers) but narrow (several hundred meters) flight strips forming a block of overlapping and parallel strips. Small inaccuracies in the height measurements result from the interaction among the different parts of the ALS system and differ within each strip. Therefore, some additional strips are flown perpendicular to the main flight direction and across the first set of strips. Strip adjustment is carried out by using information from the additional flight strips. Even if low density data are acquired for the main block, due to the double coverage, the return density under the additional strips flown may be high enough for the use of individual tree crown (ITC) approaches. The study analyzed how this kind of high and low density ALS data can be combined in order to improve k-nearest neighbor (kNN) predictions. An ITC approach was followed to predict tree attributes for automatically segmented tree crowns on more than 580 artificially created sample plots under high density flight strips. No field-measured trees were available for these artificial plots. The predicted tree attributes of the artificial plots and the measured tree attributes of 154 sample plots were then aggregated to the plot level. For all sample plots, plot-level metrics were derived from low density ALS data. The metrics were used as explanatory variables in a kNN model to predict above-ground biomass. The kNN model was validated on external data. The combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in smaller relative root mean squared differences (RRMSD) (26.7\%) compared to the use of the sample plots alone (28.5\%). It can be concluded that the use of artificial plots improves the accuracy of kNN predictions. This is especially the case if the data range of sample plots for which predictions are sought is not adequately covered by the sample plots used to fit the kNN model. To illustrate this, approximately 30\% of the sample plots with the largest and smallest biomass values were omitted. In this case, the combined use of artificial plots and sample plots resulted in a RRMSD of 29.7\%, whereas the use of the sample plots alone resulted in a RRMSD of 37.4\%.},

Systematic sampling on a real line (   R   ) is a very attractive method within which biomedical imaging is consulted by practitioners. For the systematic sampling on    R   , the measurement function (    M F    ) occurs by slicing the three-dimensional object equidistant systematically. The currently-used covariogram model in variance approximation is tested for the different measurement functions in a class to see the performance on the variance estimation of systematically-sampled    R   . An exact calculation method is proposed to calculate the constant     λ ( q , N )     of the confidence interval in the systematic sampling. The exact value of constant     λ ( q , N )     is examined for the different measurement functions, as well. As a result, it is observed from the simulation that the proposed     M F     should be used to check the performances of the variance approximation and the constant     λ ( q , N )    . Synthetic data can support the results of real data.},

	abstract = {Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data with a sampling density of 0.9–1.2 m−2 collected over 133 georeferenced field sample plots and 56 forest stands located in young and mature forest. The plot size was 300–400 m2 and the average stand size was 1.7 ha. Spruce and pine were the dominant tree species. Canopy height distributions were created from both first and last pulse data. The laser data were acquired in 1999 and 2001. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were computed from the laser-derived canopy height distributions. Corresponding metrics derived from the 1999 and 2001 laser datasets were compared. Forty-five of 54 metrics derived from the first pulse data changed their values significantly due to forest growth. The upper height percentiles increased their values more than the field-based height growth estimates. The 50 and 90 height percentiles increased by 0.4–1.3 m whereas the field-estimated mean height increased by 0.2–0.9 m. Metrics derived from the last pulse data were less influenced by growth. Mean tree height (hL), basal area (G), and volume (V) were regressed against the laser-derived variables to predict corresponding values of hL, G, and V based on the 1999 and 2001 laser data, respectively. Forest growth was estimated as the difference between the 2001 and 1999 estimates. Laser data were able to predict a significant growth in all the three biophysical variables over the 2-year period. However, the accuracy of the predictions was poor. In most cases the predictions were biased and the precision was low. Finally, several key issues of particular relevance to laser-based monitoring of forest growth are discussed.},
