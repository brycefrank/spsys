**spsys** is an R package that allows users to explore systematic variance estimators.

Many environmental surveys use systematic sampling to produce estimates of population parameters. Estimating the precision of estimates from systematic sampling designs has proven a difficult task, with several systematic variance estimators proposed over the past several decades. While not exhaustive, `spsys` implements several different variance estimators and provides diagnostic and simulation tools to allow analysts to select an appropriate variance estimator for their population. More specifically, `spsys` provides variance estimation for surveys that rely on point estimates of attributes of interest that use the Horvitz-Thompson estimator in two-dimensional settings.

`spsys` derives its classes from the popular `sp` package, thus all `sp`-related functions such as `sp::plot`, `rgdal::writeOGR`, etc. work with no further modifications.

This readme provides a cursory overview of the functionality of this package. Refer to the publication [] for a more expansive description as well as the user manual.

## Installation

Install this package directly from GitHub using `devtools`

```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/brycefrank/sys)
```

## Getting Started

`spsys` operates on a modified version of the now ubiquitious `sp` package `SpatialPointsDataFrame` class. The entry point into `sys` are the `HexFrame` and `RectFrame` classes, which represent hexagonal systematic and rectangular systematic sampling configurations respectively.

For example, we can load in a set of points from a hexagonal grid:

```{r}
hex_points <- readOGR('my_hex_points.shp')
hex_frame <- HexFrame(hex_points, c('vol', 'ba'), N=10000)
```

`HexFrame` takes two arguments: a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` and a vector of column names that indicate attributes we are interested in conducting the analyses on. Here we indicate volume (vol) and basal area (ba) as our attributes of interest, and we indicate that the population size is `N=10000`. `HexFrame`, and its sister class `RectFrame` (for rectangular systematic samples), implement a standard interface upon which variance estimators can be constructed.

### Estimating Variances

Once we have wrapped our sample information within a `HexFrame` or `RectFrame`, the next step is to construct a variance estimator. For example, we can construct a variance estimator that assumes simple random sampling was conducted, as is common practice for many environmental sample surveys.

```
my_srs_estimator <- VarSRS(fpc=TRUE)
```

`my_srs_estimator` now represents a function that, when we pass this function a `HexFrame` or `RectFrame`, will return the variance estimate.

```
my_srs_estimator(hex_frame)
```

### Variance Assessment

`spsys` allows for the assessment the behavior of variance estimators via simulation. This is done by treating an existing `SysFrame` as a population, and sampling repeatedly from it. Consider the following example where we treat `hex_frame` as a population

```{r}
a <- 3
subsample(hex_frame, c(1,1), a)
```

where `c(1,1)` is the starting position in index space and `a=3` is the sampling interval. Fans of the `dplyr` package may want to use pipe operators. That is also possible

```{r}
hex_frame %>% subsample(c(1,1), a)
```

In most assessments we will be interested in all possible subsamples. Here we iterate over all possible subsamples and compute the simple random sampling with replacement estimator

```{r}
all_starts <- subsample_starts(a)

for(i in 1:nrow(all_starts)) {
  subsample(hex_frame, all_starts[i,]) %>%
    my_srs_estimator()
}
```

## Implemented Estimators

In total, seven unique estimators are implemented, each of which contains the ability for further configuration. The particular formal definitions of these estimators are described in the manual and the publication [].
